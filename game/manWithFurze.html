<h1> Man with Furze </h1>

<p>The two pig brothers next ran into a Man with Furze. For those who do not know, furze, is basically a bundle of sticks. When the brothers saw the furze the third pig was very unimpressed, but the second pig, he was ecstatic.</p>
<p>"Oh my! What lovely Furze!" The second brother exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much!" The Man said, "you know, if you like it that much, I would be willing to give it to you if you wanted to build something with it."</p>
<p>"Really!" Shouted the second pig, tickled pinker than usual.</p>
<p>"Are you seriously going to build your house out of this furze! You are almost as bad as our brother if you do." The third pig exclaimed.</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="manWithFurzeYes.html">"First off, our brother is wonderful! Secondly, I totally am going to build my house out of this amazing furze, stop hating brother!" Stated the second pig, with his hand on his hip. </a></li>
   
 <li> <a href="manWithFurzeNo.html">"I love this furze sooooo much! I can't build a house out of it, but I would love to build some bird houses for my future house out of it" Said the second pig. </a></li>
</ul>
