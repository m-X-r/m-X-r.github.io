<h1> Down-Hill </h1>

<p>The man tried to remain calm. He started collecting all the things he dropped. The milk, the candy, he was reaching for the butter churn when he had an idea.</p>

<p>"I'll just stuff the pig into the butter churn, then when I pass the wolf, he won't think twice about me. He has never seen me with pig, he doesn't even know we are friends. This will be great!" The man said aloud to try and help calm his nerves</p>

<p>Since the pig was still in a fair stupor it wasn't hard for the man to stuff him into the churn. What was hard was picking the churn up with the pig inside. The man just had it up and then he dropped it. The churn rolled down the hill. By the time it got close to the wolf it was traveling at an incredible speed. The wolf jumped out the way to avoid being flattened and he happen to land in a prickly bush.</p>

<p>"Howwwwwl!" He cried out as he jumped out the bush. "Howwwwl, howwwllll, hooowwwwllllll!" The wolf cried all the way back to his home.</p>

<p>The churn finally slowed down around the same time the man was able to catch up with it. He checked inside to see how the pig was doing. The pig seemed dizzy, but overall, still in one piece. The man decided it was best to just slowly roll the pig home in the churn.</p>
