<h1> First Pigs House </h1>

<p>The pigs spent the night in the first pig's new straw home. Early in the morning before they could make breakfast there was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>"Who is it!" the first pig shouted. "This is private property!"</p>
<p>In reply they heard a deep husky voice. "Private property my eye, this looks like the grocery store and I've come to get my breakfast, now let me in!"</p>
<p>The third pig looked out the window and saw a great wolf."It's a wolf come to eat us he whispered to the other two pigs, what should we do?"</p>
<p>The pig brothers came up with a plan. The first pig kept verbally antagonizing the wolf while the other two build a large fire and made two large fans out of the straw they used for a bed. Right when the wolf got ready to blow the house down, they opened the door and fanned smoke outside. The wolf got a lungful of smoke with the big breath in he took in order to blow down the house. He started coughing and the pigs pushed him into the fire while he was distracted.</p>
<p>"Serves him right!" The first pig said "Thanks brothers!"</p>
<p>Then they all jumped in the air and high fived. They all ate breakfast together and together they headed off to town to find their fortunes.</p>

<p>The End.</p>

<p>Only it's not the end that we want, mostly because we are telling the story of the three little pigs. In that story the first pig gets eaten, so this is not that story. Games over for you!</p>
