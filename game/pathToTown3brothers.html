<h1> Path to Town </h1>

<p>"I hope he will be alright without us," the second pig said to the third.</p>
<p>"He's a big boy, he will be fine, now let's go!" The third pig fussed back at the second.</p>
<p>Actually, the third pig was also very worried about his brother, this being the only time they had ever been apart. But he felt it was best to stay strong for the both of them at the time. So, the pig brothers got back on the road to town in order to find their fortunes. Keeping in mind what the Man with straw had said. There was no going back, only forward, and maybe to the side.</p>
