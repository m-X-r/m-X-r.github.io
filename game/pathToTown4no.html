<h1> Second Pigs House </h1>

<p>The pigs spent the night in the second pig's new furze home. They stayed up late making birdhouses. Early in the morning before they could make breakfast there was a knock on the door. "Who is it!" the second pig shouted. "This is private property!"</p>
<p>In reply they heard a deep husky voice. "Private property my eye, this looks like the grocery store and I've come to get my breakfast, now let me in!"</p>
<p>The third pig looked out the window and saw a great wolf. "It's a wolf come to eat us he whispered to his brother, what should we do?"</p>
<p>The pig brothers came up with a plan. The second pig finished making, and eating his breakfast while the third pig build a large fire. "I think best after breakfast" the second pig said to the third. "That is how I have come up with a great idea!" the second pig said.</p>
<p>The pigs then tipped the breakfast pot sideways in the fire with some of the furze they used to make their beds. Right when the wolf got ready to blow the house down, they opened the door. "Breakfast is served," the second pig said with a flourish and he pranced off towards the pot.</p>
<p>The wolf rushed in hungry with anticipation, but as soon as the pig got close to the pot he ducked. The first pig knocked the wolf into the pot with his furze, while the second pick nocked the pot over with his, trapping the wolf underneath. "Serves him right!" The second pig said "Thanks brother!" Then they both jumped in the air and high fived.</p>
<p>Thats when they thought, we should go and check on our brother. They made their way back to their first brothers house and found it destroyed. "I bet that wolf got to him first. Curse that Wolf!" The third pig shouted, shaking his fist at the sky.</p>
<p>At that moment their first brother popped out of the woods. "Oh, I am so glad you guys are ok!"</p>
<p>"What happen to you? To your house!" asked the second pig.</p>
<p>"That wolf came and threatened to eat me for breakfast. He huffed and puffed and blew my house down. He then rushed in to eat me, but I used my breakfast oatmeal and some straw to shape a pig shaped decoy while he was huffing. When he rushed in, I ran straight into the woods. Good things wolves have such a horrible sense of taste. I've been cowering in the woods for a whole day and night now!"</p>
<p>"We are together now brother," the second pig said. "No need to cower, we can face anything together."</p>
<p>"That's right, come with us brother. Our second brother has built a house out of furze, and we have fixed that wolf up proper. He will not bother us anymore." The third pig said.</p>
<p>So, the pigs went to the furze house and got their first brother all fixed up, they even made him breakfast. After that they all went to town and found their fortunes together.</p>

<p>The End.</p>

<p>Only it's not the end that we want, mostly because we are telling the story of the three little pigs. In that story the first and second pigs get eaten. No pigs got eaten just now, so this is not that story. Shut it Down!</p>
