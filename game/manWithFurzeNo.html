<h1> Man with Furze </h1>

<p>"I'd be honored to give you this furze to build a bird house, even though it is not a house, it's still a lovely thing to build." Said the Man with a little bow.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much! I will save the first one I build for you." Said the second pig.</p>
<p>The second pig collected the furze, and him and his brother made their way to town. They found a nice duplex in town with a kindly landlord. The third pig kept his word and started building birdhouses. They were original and extravagant. They quickly became a hit in towns far and wide.</p>

<p>The third pig would have never guessed his fortune would have been build off bird houses but it was. He went back to move his mom in with him and his brother. Thats when he found his first brother missing. The third pig always felt his brother could not handle the pressure of building a fortune and ran off somewhere, he just could not for the life of him, figure out why he had destroyed such a nice straw house.</p>
<p>Years later the Man that had given him that first bundle of furze came to see him. As promised the third pig had saved his first birdhouse ever for the Man. They had tea and a lovely chat that day.</p>
<p>The End.</p>

<p>But not the end we are looking for. This is the story of the three little pigs! In that story the second pig build his house out of sticks and subsequently got his house blown down and eaten by a wolf. This pig did none of that. So, this is not the story of the three little pigs, it is a different story. We are not telling different stories at this time, so we must end it.</p>
