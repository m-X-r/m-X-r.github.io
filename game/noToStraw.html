<h1> Man with Straw </h1>

<p>
"It's such lovely straw, but alas I cannot build my house out of it. It will not be sturdy enough in the case of a storm, or an angry wolf blowing at it attack." Said the first pig.</p>
<p>The first pig again complemented the man on his straw and begin to walk off.</p>
<p>The only problem is that this is the story of the three little pigs. In that story the first pig builds his house out of straw. In whatever story this is, the first pig did not do that, creating a whole different story. Thats not what this game is about. Sorry, not sorry!</p>
<p>You Lose!</p>
