<h1> Second Pigs House </h1>

<p>The third pig brother watched as the second built his house. After he was done, he complemented him on his work. "I am going to keep heading to town." The third pig said to the second. "Do you want to come with me?"</p>
<p>"No, no," the second pig said. "I am very tired after building that house. I think I will stay and rest."</p>
<p>"I can wait on you, spend the night in your new house and we can start fresh in the morning." The third pig suggested.</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="pathToTown4no.html">"That sounds like a great idea brother. Let's spend the night here. I have enough straw left to make us both a bed, and three birdhouses to boot!" The second pig said. </a></li>

    <li> <a href="pathToTown4yes.html">No, no I do not want to keep you from your fortune. Go on without me, I'll catch up." The second pig said. </a></li>
</ul>
