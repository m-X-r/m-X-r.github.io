<h1> Path to Town </h1>

<p>
"Well, you can just build your house in the path to town." The third pig said, "so where are you going to build it?"</p>
<p>"Just off the path, just like our brother!" The second pig exclaimed. "I like it over there." The second pig said pointing East. "It looks nice and flat over there, great place to build a house."</p>
<p>"A slightly less flimsy house than our brother." The third pig added.</p>
<p>"You brother, are a hater." The second pig said while giving the third pig some side eye.
