<h1> Second Pigs House </h1>

<p>"Ok brother, stay safe!" yelled out the third pig, as he left the second pig to rest.</p>
<p>The second pig had a sound sleep that night. In the morning he was just about to make breakfast when he heard a knock at the door. "Who is it!" He shouted. "This is private property!"</p>
<p>In reply he heard a deep husky voice. "Private property my eye, this looks like the grocery store and I've come to get my breakfast, now let me in!" The second pig looked out the window and saw a great wolf.</p>
<p>"It's a wolf come to eat me he whispered to no one in particular, what should I do? Oh, I think so much better after I have eaten breakfast."</p>
<p>While the second pig was trying to finish cooking, the wolf outside took a big breath and blew the furze house down. "I was almost done with breakfast!" were the last words the second pig got out before the wolf ate him.</p>
<p>"Breakfast of champions, second day in a row!" The wolf shouted aloud to no one in particular.</p>
