<h1> Mom Pigs House Well </h1>

<p>
The pigs walked to the family well. The third pig drew up the bucket and took a sip. The second pig nocked the bucket out of his hand.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" He exclaimed! "We need to go find our fortune, it's not at the well!"</p>

<p>The first pig chimed in "He's right, let's go."</p>

<p>Which way do they go?</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="cannotPass.html"> Go North </a></li>
    <li> <a href="cannotPass.html"> Go South </a></li>
    <li> <a href="cannotPass.html"> Go East </a></li>
    <li> <a href="momPigsHouse.html"> Go West </a></li>
</ul>
