<h1> Man with Bricks </h1>

<p>The third pig brother next ran into a Man with Bricks. "Wow!" the third pig exclaimed. "Those are some mighty fine bricks, nice and sturdy!"</p>
<p>"They sure are!" The Man replied. "Sturdiest building material around, in my opinion at least"</p>
<p>"Mine too!" The third pig replied. "I love a good brick, and the craftsmanship, incredible!" The third pig said holding a brick up over his head and spinning it around.</p>
<p>"You got a good eye pig," the Man said. "You wouldn't by chance be interested in learning how to craft bricks like these would you?"</p>
<p>"Would I! I would love too!" The third pig shouted.</p>

<p>The two went on to talk for quite a while. The Man told the third pig how he was getting older and was going out of the brickmaking business. How his biggest regret was never finding an apprentice to teach all his brick making secrets to.</p>


<ul>
    <li> <a href="manWithBrickYes.html">"I would love to be your apprentice! Pick me please, I'm amazing!" Shouted the third pig, jumping up and down.</a></li>
   
 <li> <a href="manWithBrickNo.html">"I love bricks, and the thought of making them would be so cool. But I'm off to find my fortune, unfortunately I do not have time to be your apprentice. Said the third pig, with a frown and a sigh.</a></li>
</ul>
