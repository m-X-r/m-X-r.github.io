<h1> Man with Furze </h1>

<p>
"Such lovely furze!" The second pig says as he ogles the furze. "Now I will have a home before you brother. I will have my fortune in no time!"</p>
<p>The second pig thanked the man and grabbed his hand while staring him in the eye. "I might even have enough left over to make some birdhouses. I will make a few and save the first one for you."</p>
<p>"Thanks so much! I'd love that!" The Man replies.</p>
<p>The second pig then rushed off to build his house. Which way does he go?</p>
