<h1> Third Pigs House </h1>

<p>
The wolf started to stomp off, then his stomach rumbled. He was a little mad that he was being treated with such disrespect, as well as sad. Why did no one like him! He thought. His stomach continued to rumble. Since his breakfast had an attitude problem, he decided to go to the turnip field West of the third pig's house. He got a whole bundle full and went home.</p>
<p>He never really cooked turnips before but figured he had to eat something. He sliced and diced and sautéed and boiled. He created a magnificent turnip dish. It was the best thing he ever ate. He decided to start growing his own turnips, he ended up growing other vegetables as well. He kept improvising new dishes, delicious veggie dishes.</p>
<p>He started trading his food for seeds to grow new vegetables. Soon people began to seek him out to try his food. They would bring him new seeds or exotic vegetables in exchanged for his tasty food. The wolf not only became a full-fledged vegetarian, he also became a vegetarian celebrity chef!</p>
<p>Though him and the pig never really became friends they did agree to be civil with each other. The pig and the man made the wolf a brick wood burning pizza stove in exchange for the stove, and eating the pig's brothers, the wolf would make them veggie pizza every week. They wouldn't eat it together but it was as close to a peace offering as the wolf could provide, food for food is how the wolf saw it.</p>
<p>Despite hating the wolf, the pig and the man thought the wolfs pizza was delicious. They also got a lot of business from all the people going to the wolfs house for food and seeing the pizza stove. So, everyone more or less lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
<p>The End Not! In the story of the three little pigs the wolf jumped down the third pig’s chimney. He didn't become a world class vegetarian chef!</p>
