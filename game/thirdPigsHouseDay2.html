<h1> Third Pigs House </h1>

<p>The next day as they were eating breakfast, the man and the pig heard a tumultuous knock at the door."Hey, hey, hey! It's me, the wolf from yesterday! I went to the field, I was a little late, I didn't see you there."</p>
<p>"A little late!" Cried the pig, "try over forty-five minutes late!"</p>
<p>"What? Whatever man! I wasn't that late! Hey how about you let me in and share some of those turnips you got?" The wolf asked.</p>
<p>"How about I don't do that." The pig replied.</p>
<p>"Fine, fine, be mad about me being a little late. Even though I apologized for it ages ago, and, even though it wasn't that late." Said the wolf.</p>
<p>"You what?" The pig started to say when the wolf cut him off.</p>
<p>"How about this, tomorrow, at 3pm this time, meet me at that apple tree to the east of here. We can pick apples together. Pigs and apples go together, well right? I mean, pigs like apples, right? I will hoist you up into the tree and you can throw apples down to me."</p>
<p>"Hum, I guess I can let bygones be bygones, sure, maybe." Said the pig "See you tomorrow maybe."</p>
<p>With that the wolf walked away with a tremendous smirk. The man looked at the pig.</p>
<p>"So what time are we going to get apples tomorrow?" The man said to the pig.</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="appleTreeYes.html">"About Noon seems fine to me," the pig replied.</a></li>
    <li> <a href="appleTreeNo.html">We, defiantly are not going at all. You can go if you want though," the pig said. </a></li>
</ul>
