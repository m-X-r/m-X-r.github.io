<h1>
Welcome to the Library
</h1>

<p>
You walk into the house and though it is cozy the front room seems to keep going. You walk for just a bit because its very dim but then it gets brighter. Not like florecent light bright but like 6 candles vs 2 bright. And you run into a desk. No one was behind the desk but there was a sign that said Welcome to The Library. Feel Free to browse the shelves. If you would like to apply for a card please ring the bell. If you need help please see the manual on the desk.
