<h1>
The Library Card Application
</h1>

<p>
This obvious Librarian is suddenly bending down behind the desk at the entrance-esk of The Library. They pull out a small index card and hand it to you. On the card is written to apply for The Library card you need to provide The Library with at least two, not more than 4 personal references (who must possess The Library Card themselves) to vouch for your character and ablility to properly, moraly, and dutifully use The Library Card and the services it provides. Two to four you say? The obvious Librarian just smiles and nods.
