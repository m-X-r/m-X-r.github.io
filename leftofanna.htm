You go to the house to the left of Anna's house. All the lights are off it looks eerie as all git out. You walk up to the door, take a deep breath and ring the doorbell. You don't hear anything. You look down in confusion and see a post it on the ground that says doorbell broken will be fixed on monday. It must have fallen off the door.
