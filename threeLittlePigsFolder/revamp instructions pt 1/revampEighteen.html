<h1>Pro Tips</h1>

<p>Here are some pro tips. After I made all my pages for my game I went back and spell checked them. Since we are using notepad there is no spell check. This is the easiest way I found to go through this process. It also gave me freedom adjust the formatting of my pages, as well as check my game to make sure all my links work the way they should.</p>

<p>I start by opening up the first page of my game in my web browser, word, as well as the notepad file of whatever page I am on. If you are ever unsure of what page you are on, if you look in your web browser. Where you type in all your web pages at, you will see the file path. At the end is usually the name of the file the browser is accessing. In this example I am on the man with straw page. If you look in the web address bar you will see E:/three%20little%20pigs/game/manWithStraw.html. manWithStraw.html is my file name. Once I am sure I have the same page pulled up in my browser and my notepad, I copy the text that I know is in between my <p> tags from my web browser web page.</p>

<img src="pictures/protip1.jpg" alt="protip1" height="" width="1000px">

<p>Next, I paste that text into Word and correct any errors.</p>

<img src="pictures/protip2.JPG" alt="protip2" height="" width="1000px">

<p>Then I cut that text and paste it inside my notepad document between my &ltp&gt opening and closing tags and fulfil the most important step. </p>

<img src="pictures/protip3.JPG" alt="protip2" height="" width="1000px">

<p>At this point I will also change any formatting in my paragraphs that I may want.</p>

<p>Lastly, I save again, then reload my web page to make sure I like what I see.</p>
