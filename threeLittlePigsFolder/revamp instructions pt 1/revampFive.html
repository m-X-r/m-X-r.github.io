<h1>Third Key Point</h1>

<h2>"The Second Pig met a man with Furze (an evergreen shrub) and asked to build a house out of it. The Second Pig then built a house.  After the house was built a wolf came and asked to come in, threatened The Second Pig said no. In return the wolf blew down his house and ate him."</h2>


<p>This section is going to go similarly to what we just did. we are going to add a Man with Furze box below the Path to Town 3 Box.</p>

<p>Next, we will add a Path to Town 4 Box South of the Man with Furze Box.</p>

<img src="pictures/pathToTown4.jpeg" alt="Path to Town 4" width="300" hight="200">

<p>This time let's put the Pigs House to the East of the Path to Town box, just to spice things up. Draw a box to the East of Path to Town 4 and name it Second Pigs House.</p>

<p>Im sure you have noticed some blank spots. We will fill them in with Cannot Pass to ensure that our player goes down the path we want. So West and East of Man with Furze make Cannot Pass boxes. Put a Cannot Pass box West of first Pigs House, as well as East of Second Pigs House. To turn anyone who comes across there back around. Lastly put a Cannot Pass box to the West of Path to Town 4.</p>

<p>Just like in the First Pigs House. We will wait and cover the text of the web pages later, as it does not affect the landscape and we donâ€™t have to go anywhere new.</p>

<p>We have now finished making our map for this third Key Point of the Story!
