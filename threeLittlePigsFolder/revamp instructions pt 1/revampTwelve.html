<h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
 

<p>Now open the text editor program on your computer. If you are using Windows it will be Notepad, if you are using an Apple IOS it will be TextEdit. I am using Windows so I will be referring to Notepad throughout this page. We are going to leave the notepad blank page open for a bit, so I can tell you all about HTML. Donâ€™t worry you will be coding soon!</p>

<p>HTML is a coding language that tells web browsers how to display information. It is based on nesting, just like Russian Dolls. </p>

<img src="pictures/russianDolls.jpg" alt="Russian Dolls" width="300" hight="200">

<p>Your containers are data types, nesting inside of other data types that tell the web browser where to put things. The content of each container is the images, text, videos, etc. that make up your web page. I know, it can seem a little confusing at first.</p>

<p>The first thing we will tackle is not a container at all. It is more like a sign, telling people what kind of Russian doll you are about to show them. It is called a Declaration; the declaration tells the internet browser that the document it is about to read is an HTML document and what version of HTML it is. To make our declaration go back to your waiting blank notepad document, at the top of the page type the following:</p>

<h2>&lt !Doctype html &gt </h2>

<p>Next, we need to complete the most important step, Saving! Go up to the top of the document and click File. Next go down to Save As and click it. A new window will open, this window will allow you to navigate to your threeLittlePigs folder. Name your document momPigsHouse.html and click save.</p>

<p>Now sit back and bask in your coolness because you are a computer programmer now! </p>

<p>Since your file is saved as an .html file, when you click on it, it will open in the web browser. If it opens in the web browser every time you click it, you may be wondering how you are going to be able to edit your file in notepad now. To open the file in notepad you will first right click on the file. Next hover over the open with option, and then select notepad. If you do not see notepad as an option, you can select the choose another app option and scroll until you see notepad.</p>

<img src="pictures/saveAs.jpg" alt="Open With Example" width="500" hight="200">

<p>Now you can open and edit all your html files. If the page is open in a web browser while you are editing, don't forget to refresh your web browser after you save in notepad so you can see the changes.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="revampThirteen.html" >Ready for the Next Step?</a></p>
