<h1> Man With Straw </h1>

<p>
The first pig, with all his straw doubles back and runs into the man who used to have the straw.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" The man asks " You will never build a house, much less make a fortune going backwards."</p>
<p>The first pig thought about that for a second. "You are right!" he shouts. Then he turns around to go forwards.
