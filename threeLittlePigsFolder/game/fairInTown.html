<h1> Fair in Town </h1>

<p>
The pig and the man made their way into town. The fair took up the entire town, it was magnificent.</p>
<p>The pig was wide eyed, "A M A Z I N G..." is all he could get out for at least the entire first hour they were there.</p>
<p>Before they knew it, it was 3:30. The man shook the pig's arm. "Hey pal, we best get going before that wolf shows up. He won't eat us here but he will defiantly eat us on our way back home."</p>
<p>"A A H, H U H?.?.?." is all the pig managed to get out. The man started to drag the pig back towards the hill.</p>
