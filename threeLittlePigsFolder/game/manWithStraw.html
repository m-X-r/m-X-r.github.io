<h1> Man With Straw </h1>

<p>
The pigs encounter a man carrying a large harvest of straw.</p>
<p>The first pig gets very excited. "Oh!" He shouts "What lovely straw, I bet that would make a mighty fine house."</p>
<p>The Man looks at the pig smiling. "Thank you for complementing my straw. If you would like to build a house it would be my honor to give you enough straw for a house. Though Iâ€™m not sure how sturdy it would be."</p>
<p>The third pig pipes in, "Are you really going to build a house out of straw brother?!"</p>
