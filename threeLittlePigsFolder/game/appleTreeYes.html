<h1> Apple Tree </h1>

<p>The next day after breakfast the man and the third pig headed out to the apple tree. Just to be safe the pig decided to take a few bricks with him to throw at the wolf just in case. They picked lots of apples once they got to the tree, they planned to make some apple pies. While picking they got into a conversation about what would make the perfect brick stove to crisp the edges of the pie just right when the pig, from the tree branches, spotted the wolf.</p>
<p>"He's coming! the pig stress whispered down to the man.</p>
<p>The man peered around the tree and saw the wolf coming. The pig threw an apple long towards the wolf. The wolf, turned and saw the apple rolling down the path, back the way he had come. He took off after it drooling.</p>
<p>"He sure is hungry." The man said, but when he turned, he saw the pig had already jumped out the tree with his apples was half way to the house.</p>
<p>He turned back just in time to see the wolf trip and fall. He fell hard, hit his head on a rock in the path, looked as if he knocked himself out. "Suppose I should go," said the man to no one in particular.</p>
<p>When the man and the pig got home, they decided to plot out how that pie crust crisping stove would work. They drew up plans and even built a prototype.</p>
