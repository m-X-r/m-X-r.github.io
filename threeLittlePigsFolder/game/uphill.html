<h1> Up-Hill </h1>

<p>
The man and the pig come upon a hill they must climb to get to town. The man having had been to town before was aware of the hill. The pig, who had never been to town was woefully unprepared.</p>
 
<p>"Are you kidding me!" The pig exclaimed "No way am I going to be able to go up that!"</p>
 
<p>"Imagine doing it with a bunch of bricks." The man said "You will have to get used to it."</p> 

<p>The pig looked at the man with sad eyes. "I guess you are right," the pig said with a sad voice.</p> 

<p>"I am right," the man said, "lucky for you, you don't have to get used to it your first time around. Climb abord!" The man said as he bent down so the pig could climb on his back. 
with that the man made his way up the hill as the pig cheered him on.

    <li> <a href="fairInTown.html">"Oh wow!" the pig shouted. "I can see the town from here, we are almost there!" </a></li>
