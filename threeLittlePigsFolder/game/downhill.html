<h1> Down-Hill </h1>

<p>
The man and the pig, well mostly the man, because the pig was in a first-time fair stupor the entire time. The man found and successfully purchased a butter churn at the fair. He also got some milk for making butter, and candy for their apples. Carrying all the purchases and dragging the pig became a real problem for the man.</p>
<p>Once they got to the top of the hill, the man accidentally dropped everything. A little upset because the pig was still in a stupor, the man was standing there trying to assess his situation when he saw something. It was the wolf, at the bottom of the hill. Not knowing what to do the man had to think fast.</p>
<p>What did he do? 
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="downhillNo.html">Run around in circles frantic, and then start throwing things down the hill. </a></li>
    <li> <a href="downhillYes.html">Start collecting all the things he dropped in order to make haste away from there. </a></li>
</ul>
