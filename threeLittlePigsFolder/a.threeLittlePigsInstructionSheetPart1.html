<li>Key Points are important as they will help us build our map to tell the story. After we have our map we will make web pages for each area of our map to create our text-based RPG html game. Its best practice to complete your map before you start coding so you will have a guideline to go by, even though things can and probably will change on your map as you begin coding.
</li>

<!--  F I R S T   K E Y   P O I N T -->

<li id="lock1"> Lets start with the first Key Point
<br>
<span > <a href= #key1 > Up to first Key Point </a> </span>

<br><br>

<b>A Mom Pig sent her three kids off to seek their fortunes.</b>

<br><br>

<p>To imagine this in the case of an RPG its best to start to turn the story into a map. So, imagine a grid and each box of the grid is going to be a new part of the map to your story. In this case let’s start our map at the home of this mom pig and her kids. Draw a square in the middle of your paper and inside write Mom Pigs House. To read a map you need a compass. Compasses have a N (up) South (down) East (right) and West (left). So, for this example instead of using up, down, right, and left, we are going to use North, South, East, and West to represent those directions. Lets draw a compass in the corner of our map.</p>
<img src="momPigsHouse.jpeg" alt="Mom Pigs House with Compass" width="300" hight="200">

<p> If you start at the Moms house what is N, S, E and W of the house? For this we must use our imaginations to imagine the type of place where the three little pigs grew up. To do this we can come up with something on our own or use the illustrations in the story itself. For this example, we will use the illustrations in the story itself. </p>

<p>From the image it looks like the pig family lived in some rolling hills with small trees and flowers everywhere. To have a house I feel like the pigs would need Food and Water to go with their shelter. As we see later in the story there are places nearby for them to go and collect food, like the turnip field or the apple tree. That leads me to think that they would have to have someplace to store the food they collected. So, let’s say to the West of Mom Pigs House there is their Food Shed where the keep all the food they collect. Now draw a box to the west of Mom Pigs House box draw a box and call it Food Shed.</p>
<img src="foodShed.jpeg" alt="Food Shed" width="300" hight="200">

<p>To the East of Mom Pigs House let’s put a well so they can have fresh water. Draw another box to the East and label it Mom Pigs House Well. </p>
<img src="momPigsHouseWell.jpeg" alt="Mom Pigs House Well" width="300" hight="200">

<p> I think to the North of the house Should be a drop off giving them a lovely view of all the rolling hills and trees and such. To the North of Mom Pigs House draw a box and label it Rolling Hills Drop Off. </p>
<img src="rollingHillsDropoff.jpeg" alt="Rolling Hills Drop Off" width="300" hight="200">

<p>Now to the South of Mom Pigs House I think should be a path to get to town, because the three little pigs need a way to get going to make that fortune. So, to the South of Mom Pigs House draw another box and label it Path to Town.</p>
<img src="pathToTown.jpeg" alt="Path to Town" width="300" hight="200">

<p>Now we have 5 boxes; Mom Pigs House, Mom Pigs House Well, Rolling Hills Drop Off and Path to Town, as well as our Compass. Let’s expand our Map. We mostly want our story to focus on the pigs heading to town and running into the wolf. So, I think the only way to go should be the path to town. How do we do this? We need to define the N, S, E, W of all our squares and make them go "nowhere". We will start this process at Mom Pigs House Well.  Mom Pigs House is to the West of the well so draw boxes for North, South, and East around Mom Pigs House Well, and inside write Cannot Pass.</p>
<img src="cannotPassWell.jpeg" alt="Cannot Pass the Well" width="300" hight="200">

<p> As you can see that already fills our East boxes for Rolling Hills Drop Off as well as Path to Town. Now we will draw boxes North and West of Rolling Hills Drop Off and write cannot pass in them as well. </p>
<img src="cannotPassRollingHills.jpeg" alt="Cannot Pass the Rolling Hills" width="300" hight="200">

<p>Here Comes the Food Shed, draw boxes to the West and South of the Food Shed, and write cannot pass inside.</p>
<img src="cannotPassFoodShed.jpeg" alt="Cannot Pass the Food Shed" width="300" hight="200">

<p> All that is left now is the South side of the Path to Town box. We want the path to go South, so for South we will draw our box and name it Path to Town 2.</p>
<img src="pathToTown2.jpeg" alt="Path to Town 2" width="300" hight="200">

<p> We have now finished making our map for this first Key Point of the Story!</p>
 </li>

<!-- S E C O N D   K E Y   P O I N T -->

<li id="lock2"> Time to move on to our second Key Point!
<br>
<span > <a href= #key2 > Up to second Key Point </a> </span>

<br><br>

<b>The First Pig met a man with straw and asked for it to build a house. The First Pig then built a house. After the house was built a wolf came and asked to come in, threatened The First Pig said no. In return the wolf blew down his house and ate him.</b>

<br><br>

<p>Since The first pig meets a Man with Straw we need to have him on the path somewhere so that the pigs can run into him. To make sure our player is forced to interact with the Man with Straw we need to make the West and East of Path to Town 2 unpassable, while making its South side a box we will call Man with Straw. </p>
<img src="manWithStraw.jpeg" alt="Man with Straw" width="300" hight="200">

<p>As you can see I have used up my piece of paper. Never fear Tape is here! I’m just going to grab another sheet of paper and tape it to my map. Make sure to tape on the back so the strips of tape do not impede your drawing.</p>
<img src="tapedBack.jpeg" alt="Taped Back" width="300" hight="200">
<img src="tapedFront.jpeg" alt="Taped Front" width="300" hight="200">

<p>So, When the Pigs meet the man we can add some options and some dialogue. For now, we are only focusing on the map so we will cover that option when we start making web pages. In my version of this story after the pigs pass the Man with the Straw the First Pig will want to build his house as soon as possible. So, to the South of Man with Straw draw a box and label it Path to Town 3. </p>
<img src="pathToTown3.jpeg" alt="Path to Town 3" width="300" hight="200">

<p>Then to the West of Path to Town 3 draw a box and call it First Pigs House.</p>
<img src="firstPigsHouse.jpeg" alt="First Pigs House" width="300" hight="200">

<p>Next, we can fill the West and East around Man with Straw, as well as the East of Path to Town 3 with Cannot Pass. This ensures that our player more likely to enter the First Pigs House.</p>
<img src="cannotPassFirstPigsHouse.jpeg" alt="Cannot Pass First Pigs House" width="300" hight="200">

<p> Now the next part of this point, the part with the blowing the house down and eating by the wolf. We will need to wait and cover that in the text of the web pages, as it does not affect the landscape. The house may be blown down, but it’s still in the same spot, and we don’t have to go anywhere new. So, we have now finished making our map for this second Key Point of the Story!</p>

<!--   T H I R D   K E Y   P O I N T   -->

<li id="lock3"> Time to move on to our third Key Point!
<br>
<span > <a href= #key3 > Up to third Key Point </a> </span>

<br><br>

<b>The Second Pig met a man with Furze (an evergreen shrub) and asked to build a house out of it. The Second Pig then built a house.  After the house was built a wolf came and asked to come in, threatened The Second Pig said no. In return the wolf blew down his house and ate him.</b>

<br><br>

<p>This section is going to go similarly to what we just did. we are going to add a Man with Furze box below the Path to Town 3 Box.</p>
<img src="manWithFurze.jpeg" alt="Man with Furze" width="300" hight="200">

<p>Next, we will add a Path to Town 4 Box South of the Man with Furze Box.</p>
<img src="pathToTown4.jpeg" alt="Path to Town 4" width="300" hight="200">

<p>This time let's put the Pigs House to the East of the Path to Town box, just to spice things up. Draw a box to the East of Path to Town 4 and name it Second Pigs House.</p>
<img src="secondPigsHouse.jpeg" alt="Second Pigs House" width="300" hight="200">

<p>Im sure you have noticed some blank spots. We will fill them in with Cannot Pass to ensure that our player goes down the path we want. So West and East of Man with Furze make Cannot Pass boxes. Put a Cannot Pass box West of first Pigs House, as well as East of Second Pigs House. To turn anyone who comes across there back around. Lastly put a Cannot Pass box to the West of Path to Town 4.</p>
<img src="cannotPassSecondPigsHouse.jpeg" alt="Cannot Pass Second Pigs House" width="300" hight="200">

<p>Just like in the First Pigs House. We will wait and cover the text of the web pages later, as it does not affect the landscape and we don’t have to go anywhere new. So, we have now finished making our map for this third Key Point of the Story!
</p>
 </li>

<!--    F O U R T H   K E Y  P O I N T   -->

<li id="lock4"> Time to move on to our fourth Key Point!
<br>
<span > <a href= #key4 > Up to fourth Key Point </a> </span>

<br><br>

<b>The Third Pig met a man with bricks and asked to build a house out of them. The third Pig then built a house. After the house was built a wolf came and asked to come in, threatened The Third Pig said no and the wolf attempted to blow down the house. The wolf tried and tried but could not blow down The Third Pigs house.</b>

<br><br>

<p>This is going to go just like the First and Second Pigs Houses. We are going to make a Man with Bricks Box, as well as an additional box of Path to Town, ending with a Third Pigs House box.</p>
<img src="thirdPigSetup.jpeg" alt="Third Pig Setup" width="300" hight="200">

<p>Now we are going to block off all the paths we do not want people to take. Add in your Cannot Pass boxes where they need to go.</p>
<img src="cannotPassThirdPigsHouse.jpeg" alt="Cannot PassThird Pigs House " width="300" hight="200">

<p>Again, the blowing down house attempt will come in the code but we are sticking to the map for now. We Have now finished our Fourth Key Point of the map!
</p>

<!--   F I F T H   K E Y   P O I N T   -->

<li id="lock5"> Time to move on to our fifth Key Point!
<br>
<span > <a href= #key5 > Up to fifth Key Point </a> </span>

<br><br>

<b>The wolf then invited the pig to come and get turnips with him the following evening. The pig agreed but left earlier than the appointed time and got the turnips home before the wolf showed up.</b>

<br><br>

<p>Now for this point we get to add some new map! No more Pig Houses! We must decide where the Turnip Field is in relation to the Third Pigs House. Now in the illustration on Hoopla I see a tree lined lake front behind the Third Pig. I don’t think that lake front would be on the Path to Town so we should make a new path. This new path will be less of a path and more of a lake front.</p>
<img src="lakeFrontCorrection.jpeg" alt="Lake Front Correction " width="300" hight="200">

<p> As you can see I decided to put the lake front to the West of the Third Pigs House. Instead of that remaining a Cannot Pass Area. It happens so try not to get caught up on your current version of the map being the final version. Its easier to correct something that exist than it is to create the perfect thing from scratch. Lets put the Turnip Field on the other side of the Lake Front.</p>
<img src="turnipField.jpeg" alt="Turnip Field " width="300" hight="200">

<p>Then we can block off everything else. At least for now. </p>
<img src="cannotPassTurnipField.jpeg" alt="Cannot Pass Turnip Field " width="300" hight="200">

<p>Now we have finished the fifth Key Point!</p>
</li>

<!--    S I X T H   K E Y   P O I N T   -->

<li id="lock6"> Time to move on to our sixth Key Point!
<br>
<span > <a href= #key6 > Up to sixth Key Point </a> </span>

<br><br>

<b>The wolf upset invited the pig to collect apples with him the following evening. The pig agreed but left earlier than the appointed time. The trip took longer than expected and he ran into the wolf while up in the apple tree. The wolf inquired about the apples and the pig threw him one, but he threw it far enough for him to run home.</b>

<br><br>

<p>Since we put the Lake Front to the West of the Third Pigs House we should put the Apple Tree to the East. We are going to change the Cannot Pass box to the east of Path to Town 5 into the Apple Tree. That way its close enough for it to make sense for the Third Pig to have run all the way home after throwing an apple far.</p>
<img src="appleTree.jpeg" alt="Apple Tree " width="300" hight="200">


<p>Now we will block off all the other areas, including the area South of the Third Pigs House.</p>
<img src="cannotPassAppleTree.jpeg" alt="Cannot Pass Apple Tree " width="300" hight="200">

<p>Now the only way we can go is To Town, which is where the Fair is. Looks like we are on the right track! It also looks like we are done with the sixth Key Point! </p>
</li>

<!--    S E V E N T H   K E Y   P O I N T   -->

<li id="lock7"> Time to move on to our seventh Key Point!
<br>
<span > <a href= #key7 > Up to seventh Key Point </a> </span>
<br><br>

<b>The next day the wolf invited the pig to a fair in town that very afternoon. The pig agreed but left earlier than the appointed time. At the fair he bought a butter churn. On his way home, the pig saw the wolf before the wolf saw him and jumped in the churn and rolled down the hill towards the wolf. The wolf was frightened and ran away.</b>

<br><br>

<p>Now, we will continue just like before and add a space after Path to Town 5. This time we are going to make a Hill, so the pig with have something to roll down to scare the wolf. It will be uphill going towards town and downhill going towards the Third Pigs House. We don’t have to put that in the box but we do need to keep it in mind when we start to code.</p>
<img src="hill.jpeg" alt="Hill " width="300" hight="200">

<p>Next we just need to add a block for the Fair in Town.</p>
<img src="townFair.jpeg" alt="Town Fair " width="300" hight="200">

<p>And with that we have completed our Map!!!!!</p>
</li>

<!--  C O D I N G   S T A R T S !  -->

<li>
<p>Now that we have our map we can start coding. We will be using html to make web pages. Along the way if you get confused I suggest you go to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank"> w3schools.com </a> and use their search bar to search for the issue you are looking for. You can also click on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" target="_blank"> Learn HTML</a> on the left side and scroll through all the different topics that pop up on the left hand side of the HTML landing page. </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The first thing we need to do to start coding, is decide where we want to save our files. Saving is the MOST IMPORTANT part of coding. You will not be able to run your code unless you save it somewhere. With html its best to save all your files in the same place, as they depend on each other to work. Decide if you want to save your files on your computer, an online cloud storage service like google drive, or a flash drive (you can even pick all three if you like). I prefer to save on a flash drive and back up my files to an online cloud storage service. I move around a lot so I'm always using different computers, so the portability of a flash drive works best for me.</p>

<p>Once you decide where you will be working create a folder and name it three little pigs rpg. When coding you dont always use spaces like you do when typing so when you create your folder use_as_spaces_or stringEverythingTogetherUsingUpperCaseLetterToBreakUpWords. If you do string everything together be sure to start with a lower case letter instead of an upper case letter.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Now open the text editor program on your computer. If you are using Windows it will be Notepad, if you are using an Apple IOS it will be TextEdit. I am using Windows so I will be referring to Notepad throughout this page. We are going to leave the notepad blank page open for a bit, so I can tell you all about HTML. Don’t worry you will be coding soon!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>HTML is a coding language that tells web browsers how to display information. It is based on nesting, just like Russian Dolls. </p>
<img src="russianDolls.jpg" alt="Russian Dolls" width="300" hight="200">

<p>Your containers are data types, nesting inside of other data types that tell the web browser where to put things. The content of each container is the images, text, videos, etc. that make up your web page. I know, it can seem a little confusing at first.</p>

<p>The first thing we will tackle is not a container at all. It is more like a sign, telling people what kind of Russian doll you are about to show them. It is called a Declaration; the declaration tells the internet browser that the document it is about to read is an HTML document and what version of HTML it is. To make our declaration go back to your waiting blank notepad document, at the top of the page type the following:</p>

<h2>&lt !Doctype html &gt </h2>

<p>Next, we need to complete the most important step, Saving! Go up to the top of the document and click File. Next go down to Save As and click it. A new window will open, this window will allow you to navigate to your threeLittlePigs folder. Name your document momPigsHouse.html and click save. Now sit back and bask in your coolness because you are a computer programmer now! </p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Since your file is saved as an .html file, when you click on it, it will open in the web browser. If it opens in the web browser every time you click it, you may be wondering how you are going to be able to edit your file in notepad now. To open the file in notepad you will first right click on the file. Next hover over the open with option, and then select notepad. If you do not see notepad as an option, you can select the choose another app option and scroll until you see notepad.</p>

<img src="saveAs.jpg" alt="Open With Example" width="500" hight="200">

<p>Now you can open and edit all your html files. If the page is open in a web browser while you are editing, don't forget to refresh your web browser after you save in notepad so you can see the changes.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Now we are going to create our first container, using an HTML Element. An HTML element or container, as I will be referring to them, are defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. In essence:</p>

<h2>&lt tagname &gt...content goes here...&lt tagname &gt </h2>

<p>Our first "Container" or HTML Element is going to be our html container. This container encompasses everything else. The HTML tag is the largest Russian Doll. It tells the browser that everything inside it makes up the HTML page. In your notepad document go down a space below your declaration and type the following:</p>

<h2>
&lt!Doctype html&gt 
<br>
&lthtml&gt
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt/html&gt
</h2>

<p>Dont forget the most important step. Save!</p>

<p>Notice how there is some space between our start tag &lthtml&gt and our end tag &lt/html&gt ? That is because we are nesting things, so we need to leave space for all the other containers that need to go in between our html starting and ending tag.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Now our main document is going to consist of two big containers. Our head container and our body container. Our head container is going to mostly communicate style and our body container is going to mostly communicate substance. To add these two style and substance containers make a space below your html starting tag and indent some. Then type the following:</p>

<h2>
&lt!Doctype html&gt 
<br>
&lthtml&gt
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lthead&gt <!--HEAD-->
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/head&gt<!--/HEAD-->
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltbody&gt<!--BODY-->
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/body&gt<!--/BODY-->
<br>
<br>
&lt/html&gt
</h2>
<p>Dont forget the most important step. Save!</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Now let's style up our page just a little bit. Using another container, we are going to add a title that is going to add text to the tab that the browser will show above the web page. We are going to use a title tag to accomplish this. Go back to your notepad document. In the space below your starting head tag indent some and then type the following:</p>

<h2>
&lt!Doctype html&gt 
<br>
&lthtml&gt
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lthead&gt <!--HEAD-->
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lttitle&gt Mom Pigs House &lt/title&gt
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/head&gt<!--/HEAD-->
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltbody&gt<!--BODY-->
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/body&gt<!--/BODY-->
<br>
<br>
&lt/html&gt
</h2>

<p>Don’t forget!....... I’m sure you have the Most Important Step memorized by now so I will stop repeating it. Once that most important step is done, double click on your file. It should open in your browser and you should see something like this:</p>

<img src="momPigsHouseTitleTab.jpg" alt="Mom Pigs House Title Tab" >
</li>

<li>
<p>Now we are gearing up to add a little substance to our body container. But before we do, we need to go over some basic container types to  use inside our body container. Below I will show you some basic tags and the code you need to make them happen.</p>

<ul>
<li> <h1>H:</h1> the h or heading tag creates a heading or banner. So, you have text with a space above and below. Headings go from 1-6, one being the largest and six being the smallest. It goes h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6.
<h1>&lth1&gt H1 &lt/h1&gt</h1>

<li><h1>p:</h1> the paragraph container, it creates, well, a paragraph. It will block out whatever text you put in with a space above and below. Just like when using the word typing program.

<li><h1>ul or ol:</h1> These are unordered list and ordered list containers. They both do the exact same thing with one little difference. They create a bullet list, ul aka unordered list use round bullet points. Or they create numbered list, ol, aka ordered list use numbers.

<li><h1>a:</h1> The a container holds links to other places. It could be a webpage on the internet or a webpage that you made. You can even go to a different section of the webpage that you are on with the help of the id attribute. The id attribute, like the declaration tag, is less like a container and more like a sign.

&lth1&gt Mom Pigs House &lt/h1&gt
<br>
<br>
&ltp&gt<br>
You are at Mom Pigs House. She had three sons and she raised them to be fine young pigs. Hard times came upon Mom Pig, she barely had enough to keep them and herself. So, she sent them out to find their fortune. As the Pigs left they waived to their mom and then looked out upon the world. Which way do they go?

I bet you are feeling like a programmer now, now that you can see some text on screen! Drink it in, because you are about to see a lot more. We are going to make another page, The Well at Mom Pigs House map spot. To do this create a new notepad document and save it as momPigsHouseWell.html. Use the example above but add your own version about what the pigs encounter at the well. Need inspiration? Here is what I came up with:</p>

<br>
&lth1&gt Mom Pigs House Well &lt/h1&gt
<br>
<br>
&ltp&gt<br>
The pigs walked to the family well. The third pig drew up the bucket and took a sip. The second pig nocked the bucket out of his hand. "What are you doing?" He exclaimed! "We need to go find our fortune, it’s not at the well!" The first pig chimed in "He's right, let’s go." Which way do they go?
<br>&lt/p&gt
<br>
<br>
&ltul&gt<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go North &lt/a&gt <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go South &lt/a&gt <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go East &lt/a&gt <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go West &lt/a&gt <br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/body&gt<!--/BODY-->
<br>
<br>
&lt/html&gt
</h2>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Now that we have two pages lets fill in one of our a tags. Keeping in mind that we have our Mom Pigs House Well page open, and that Mom Pigs House is West of the Well lets fill in the West tag on this page. All your html pages must be saved in the same place so that they can work together. So make sure that all your pages are saved in the same folder. Now, in between the " " marks of the &lta href=  &gt Go West &lt/a&gt you need to type in the entire file name of the Mom Pigs House page.</p>

<h2>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href="momPigsHouse.html"&gt Go West &lt/a&gt <br>
</h2>

<p>Now, the most important step, lets save. Now we can open up our Mom Pigs House page in notepad. In the Go East a tag put in the filename for the Mom Pigs House Well page.</p>

<h2>&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href="momPigsHouseWell.html"&gt Go East &lt/a&gt <br></h2>

<p>Now when you finish, reload your Mom Pigs House web page. It should look something like this when you open it in the browser:</p>

<img src="momPigsHouseLinked.jpg" alt="Mom Pigs House Linked">

<p>Once you click the East link you should see something like this:</p>

<img src="momPigsHouseWell.jpg" alt="momPigsHouseWell.jpg">

<p>If you click Go West on your Mom Pigs House Well page it should take you back to your Mom Pigs House page.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
We are on a roll now! Before I let you loose to code your map we have just a few more things to cover.</p>

<ol>
<li>Adding Padding</li>
<li>Creating a Templet and a Style Sheet</li>
<li>Dialouge Options</li>
</ol>


<p>First off, adding padding. Padding can make our page look a little more professional by adding some space around the edges of our page. So the text will not run from the very beginning to the very end of our page. Most web pages have some empty space around all the edges, but right now ours does not. To add some, we need to add some tags in our head section. Go to the head section of your Mom Pigs House Page. Then make some space under your title tag and type the following:</p>

<h2>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lthead&gt <!--HEAD-->
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lttitle&gt Mom Pigs House &lt/title&gt
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltstyle&gt body {padding:60px;} &lt/style&gt
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/head&gt<!--/HEAD-->
</h2>

<p>Once you save and refresh your web browser, the page should look something like this:</p>

<img src="momPigsHousePadded.jpg" alt="Mom Pigs House Padded">

<p>Notice how now the text does not run all the way across the page and how far down the header has come. That is because a 60-pixel, or 60px, area around the body container has been formed, and that is providing the extra space. You can play with the amount of padding that you want. I used 60px to ensure that you could see the difference. Add style container to the head of the Mom Pigs House Well page, along with whatever amount of padding that you decide on. Whatever amount of pixels you decide on be sure to add it in both your Mom Pigs House page as well as your Mom Pigs House Well page.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Let's talk Templets and Style Sheets! I don't know about you but changing something in Mom Pigs House to style the page up and then going into Mom Pigs House well to add a few lines a code was a pain. What if we had like five pages instead of two, or five-hundred! There has got to be an easier way to change things, right? There is, and it is called a cascading style sheet, or CSS.</p>

<p> CSS is used to format the layout of a webpage, or add style. The great thing about it is its one document that you can link to as many pages as you want. So, if you change one thing on the CSS document, it changes that same thing on all your pages, weather its 2, 5, or 500! To make a style sheet open a new notepad document and save it as threeLittlePigsStyles.css in your three little pigs folder with your web pages. Now remember what style we added to our Pig Moms House and Pig Moms House Well pages? We had a title tag and a style tag. Unfortunately, each page needs its own title tag, so that will remain. As far as the style tag goes we are going to transfer that info to our CSS page. At the top of your CSS page type the following:</p>

<h2>
body  {padding:60px;}
</h2>

<p>
Now complete the Most Important Step, and open your Mom Pigs House Page. in the head section replace the style tag with a link tag:</p>

<h2>&ltlink rel="stylesheet" href=" "&gt</h2>

<p>Whenever you use this tag always include rel="stylesheet" or the tag will not work. For the href attribute you are going to put the file name of your style sheet in between the " ", in our case it is threeLittlePigsStyles.css. Be sure that your style sheet is saved in the same folder as your web pages. Open your Mom Pigs House Well page and add the Link tag above where the style tag is now in the head section. After you save you should now be able to reload your browser and see your Mom Pigs House and Mom Pigs House Well pages with padding around them. </p>

<p> Now let’s talk about templets. A template is something we can use as a pattern for all our web pages. Since we have Mom Pigs House Page the way we want it for now all we need to do is open either one of those pages. Next, we want to Save As, NOT SAVE! Save the page as templet, I like to save the templet as a .txt file. That way I’m less likely to over save a web page incorrectly as they are different file types. Since we have now saved as a different file type and a different name we can delete all the text, not the code! it should look something like this:</p>

<h2>
&lt!Doctype html&gt 
<br>
&lthtml&gt
<br>
<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lthead&gt <!--HEAD-->

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lttitle&gt  &lt/title&gt

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltlink rel="stylesheet"href="threeLittlePigsSyles.css"&gt <br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/head&gt<!--/HEAD-->
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltbody&gt<!--BODY-->
<br>
<br>
&lth1&gt  &lt/h1&gt
<br>
<br>
&ltp&gt<br>      
<br>&lt/p&gt
<br>
<br>
&ltul&gt<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go North &lt/a&gt <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go South &lt/a&gt <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go East &lt/a&gt <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go West &lt/a&gt <br>

<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/body&gt<!--/BODY-->
<br>
<br>
&lt/html&gt
</h2>
</p>

<p>
Once you save, you will now have a templet. Every time you go to make a new page just open your templet, type in the new information, SAVE AS, name the page and end with an .html extension, and you are all set.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Now Onward towards Dialogue Options. All your pages do not have to go in directions. Remember those dialogue options we skipped over earlier? Let’s skip ahead and make the page where the pigs run into the man with straw. Instead of direction let’s give our player a dialogue prompt on what to do. Below is my example but I want you to add your own dialogue and choices:</p>

<h2>
&lt!Doctype html&gt

<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltlink rel="stylesheet" href="threeLittlePigsStyles.css" &gt<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/head&gt<!--/HEAD-->
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltbody&gt<!--BODY-->
<br>
<br>
&lth1&gtThe Man With Straw&lt/h1&gt
<br>
<br>
&ltp&gtThe pigs encounter a man carrying a large harvest of straw. The first pig gets very excited. "Oh!" He shouts "What lovely straw, I bet that would make a mighty fine house." The Man looks at the pig smiling. "Thank you for complementing my straw. If you would like to build a house it would be my honor to give you enough straw for a house. Though I’m not sure how sturdy it would be." The pig’s brothers pipe in, "Are you really going to build a house out of straw brother?!"      
<br>&lt/p&gt
<br>
<br>
&ltul&gt<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt "Why yes!" the first Pig shouts. &lt/a&gt <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Never, I need a sturdy house. Lovely straw though. &lt/a&gt <br>
&lt/ul&gt
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/body&gt<!--/BODY-->
<br>
<br>
&lt/html&gt
</h2>
</p>

<p>
You can then for example make a game over page and link it to the "Never, I need a sturdy house. Lovely straw though." option. If the user picks the "Why yes!" option it can link to a page that says the pig gathered the straw and you can bring back the directional options.</p>

After which he most definitely gets eaten by a wolf. If he does not get eaten, it’s not the story of the three little pigs, and that’s not the story we are telling here.

<p>You would then follow your map and code pages for North, South, East, and West and fill in the links here. Or if you already coded those pages you can just fill in the links.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Now that you got the hang of things Go forth and code. Code out all the pages in your map. Code out dialogue options that help you tell the story. If you go into town code different pages going out of town to ensure that the player gets to roll down a hill in a butter churn and scare the wolf. Maybe give the wolf a different option rather than falling down a chimney into a boiling pot. Most importantly code an introduction page. Like a This is my game, ready to play?</p>

<p> Make it your own, and have fun. This is only the first draft so no need for it to be perfect. Remember you can correct things but you must have a thing to correct first. Need some inspiration? Check out my version down below:</p>

</p>

<p>Have fun! Happy Codi...... Oh wait.</p>

<p>P.S.</p>
<p>Here are some pro tips. After I made all my pages for my game I went back and spell checked them. Since we are using notepad there is no spell check. This is the easiest way I found to go through this process. It also gave me freedom adjust the formatting of my pages, as well as check my game to make sure all my links work the way they should.</p>

<p>I start by opening up the first page of my game in my web browser, word, as well as the notepad file of whatever page I am on. If you are ever unsure of what page you are on, if you look in your web browser. Where you type in all your web pages at, you will see the file path. At the end is usually the name of the file the browser is accessing. In this example I am on the man with straw page. If you look in the web address bar you will see E:/three%20little%20pigs/game/manWithStraw.html. manWithStraw.html is my file name. Once I am sure I have the same page pulled up in my browser and my notepad, I copy the text that I know is in between my <p> tags from my web browser web page.</p>

<img src="protip1.jpg" alt="protip1" height="" width="1000px">

<p>Next, I paste that text into Word and correct any errors.</p>

<img src="protip2.jpg" alt="protip2" height="" width="1000px">

<p>Then I cut that text and paste it inside my notepad document between my &ltp&gt opening and closing tags and fulfil the most important step. </p>

<img src="protip3.jpg" alt="protip2" height="" width="1000px">

<p>At this point I will also change any formatting in my paragraphs that I may want.</p>

<img src="protip4.jpg" alt="protip2" height="" width="1000px">

<p>Lastly, I save again, then reload my web page to make sure I like what I see.</p>

<img src="protip5.jpg" alt="protip2" height="" width="1000px">

<p>Bingo Bongo! Edited web page!</p>
<p>Now, get to coding! Have fun! and See you next time for more!</p>
