<h1>For: Pi Club</h1>

<p id="question" >I initially started writing this in order to create a templet for my pi club on how they could use childrens books to help them come up with a storyline to create a  room based HTML game. I started it before Covid hit, like 2019 and didn't finish until 2022 I was planning on creating a map based game to go along with this story, but for now just the finishing of the rewriting process is good enough for me. <br><a href="dinosDragonsNtacos/dinosDragonsAndTacos/novellaPages/CH1-Introductions.html" target="_blank">9.2.22</a> </p>
<p>Now I want more, an interactive installation with a web element like a digital turn by turn map walking tour with cardboard props....but where to start? <br>1.30.23<p/>
