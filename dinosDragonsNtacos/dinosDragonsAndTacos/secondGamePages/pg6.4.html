<h3>Dear Napkin Diary: entri 1</h3>
<p>
Last night, or at least the last night I remember before I woke up in this bootleg jail cell, I was at a party. Well the beginings of a party, it appeared as if non of the other guest had arrived yet. I wonder if they are locked up in simialar homeade cells someplace? The last thing I remember doing was eating pizza. I had two slices, sat down on the couch to eat the third and woke up in this dark dank place. The only reason I can write this is because I had a pocket full of napkins when I sat down on the couch, and I also snagged some pepper flakes, as I was thinking about partaking in some hot pizza slices, but I didnt get the chance. Now i am making a sort of peper dye with ground up flakes and drippy ceiling water and some random floor grime from the corner and using my pinkey nail as a nib pen of sorts. Just wanted to say, this sucks!
