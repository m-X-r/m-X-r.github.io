<h3>Dear Napkin Diary: entri 2</h3>
<p>It has been 31 days since I attended TK's party. I have been keeping track of days via a small crack I found in the foundation through which I can see the light and dark of outside. I should have ran when I walked into that empty party room. But the delicious smell of pizza drew me in. I grabbed a handful of napkins anticipating the greasy mess I was to encounter, then I went straght for the pizza. I should have known better than to eat pizza in dragonland, a land known for tacos! Thats how he dosed me, TK who by the way is NOT The Kid, but The Killer! I dont know why he is keeping me locked up, giving me just enough food and water for me to survive, but not to thrive. I hope I can escape before his plans for me are realized. I think I hear him coming! until  next time.<br><br>
