<h1>The Taco Party!</h1>

<p>The four dinosaurs all stood around awkwardly huddled around the front door the TK’s house. Just as Penelope was about to break the silence a dragon walked up and broke the silence for them.</p>

<p>“Oh hi, are you all here for the party too?” the dragons asked.</p>

<p>They all just stared at him, unable to speak up. Then a teenage T Rex with big hair and a neon fanny pack  spoke up.</p>

<p>"We sure are handsome, just need to get ourselves together. See you inside in a bit." she said with a coe smile. The dragon smiled back and replied “Cool! See you inside pretty lady!” with that, he pushed past the dinosaurs to get on the porch and into the party.</p>

<p>Once the door shut behind him the big haired T Rex turned to the other dinosaurs and asked why they didn’t dress up? They all looked confused and then she looked as if she remembered something. "Oh, never mind, shall we?" She said looking at another young T Rex with a brown cowboy type hat on. "Oh," stamarrd, "the door!" He rushed past everyone to open the door. As they walked in he yelled over the music, "I'm Tiny by the way!" As each dino walked in they introduced themselves.</p>

<p>The big haired T Rex went first. "Tiny you say? I'm Penelope, see you inside sweetie." She said </p>

<p>An older female with a shiny antique looking silver necklas went next. "Pine Tree? What an interesting name!" She yelled. Tiny corrected her. "Oh Tiny, quite on the nose." she smiled "My name is Rouge, nice to meet you young man." She patted Tiny's shoulder as she walked inside. </p>

<p>Last went an older male T Rex. He had a nice looking shoulder bag that seemed to be relativly full. He walked up and grabbed Tiny's hand and started shaking it vigirously while staring into Tiny's eyes. "Hi, I'm Hankree, not Hank, Hey You, or Ree. Just Hankree." Tiny nodded and Hankree made his way inside.</p>

<p> Tiny, excited about all the new dinosaurs he just met, laughed a little to himself and walked inside the party.</p>
