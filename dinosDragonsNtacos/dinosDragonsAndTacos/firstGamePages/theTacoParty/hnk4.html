<h1>Hankree Checks his Satchel!</h1>

<p>He saw the correct number of notebook spines and took off running towards the door. It was so smoky in the house that he could not see very far in front of him and ran into somebody. That person fell over and once he regained his balance he stopped over to help them. Once low enough he saw that the somebody he knocked over was Penelope.</p>

<p> She looked up at him and yelled, “Hey! What gives I was texting!” to which Hankree responded, “Text Outside!” he helped her up and they both shuffled outside. He knew she was just scared and trying to be brave, but they had to get out of there, he had no time to be plesant.  Once they were both safely outside Hankree decided to assessed his situation. Shirt, the thought looking down at his clothes,  dirty. Bag, he thought checking the exterior of his best satchel, intact. Research, he thought unzipping his satchel and looking inside, safe. Well-being,he thought, will review later. After giving himself about an 80% rating on the OK scale he turned to check in on Penelope.</p>

<p>She was texting. Hankree made a mental note, if Penelope is texting she is probably also at 80% or higher on the OK scale.</p>

<p>Hankree was just about to write this newfound observation down when some new bodies tumbled out of the burning house and hit the ground. It looked to be Tiny and Rouge. They hit the round in a tumble then Rouge grabbed Tiny in a long embrace. Interesting Hankree thought. </p>
