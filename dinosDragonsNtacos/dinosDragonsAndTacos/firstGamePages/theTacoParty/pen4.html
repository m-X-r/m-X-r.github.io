<h1>Penelope was so over this party!</h1>

<p>Why would you be as inconsiderate as to invite someone to a party, and then burn the party down, but in the less fun firery way instead of the really cool amazing way! So lame! Penelope was absolutly terrified, she didnt want to die, expecially not in an 80s baby costume at a taco party, she tried to text Katie to calm her nerves but she was finding it hard to see. The more she tried to see to text she also found that it had also become harder to breath. Suddenly something forceful knocked her to the ground, that’s when it hit her, what am I doing this house is on fire! I need to get out. She looked up and saw the old guy with all the notebooks. Penelope couldn’t remember his name and she was terrified, seemingly trapped inside this burning house. She was going to express all this to him but all she managed to get out was “What gives I was Texting!” She felt dumb for saying that as soon as the word texting left her lips. She was about to apologize when the man yelled "Text Outside!" He then pulled her to her feet and helped her out the door. Saved she thought as she stood outside, looking at her phone trying to collect herself. Her fingers automatically started typing even though her screen was blank and she was mostly just focusing on breathing. Suddenly she heard a thud and looked up to see Tiny and Rouge on the ground in a tight embrace.</p>
