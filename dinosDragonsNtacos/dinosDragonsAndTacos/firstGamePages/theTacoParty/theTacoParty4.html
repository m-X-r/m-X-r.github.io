<h1>The Taco Party! </h1>

<p>The Kid opens his mouth to respond when pandemonium broke out. A dragon that happen to be standing next to the window burped and a stream of fire came out of his mouth and now the curtains were on fire. The dragons in question seemed shocked, they were all shocked. The party came to a sudden holt as the music kept blasting and the lights kept flashing but everyone was staring at the burning curtains.</p>

<p>Staring but not putting them out! <br><br> (at this point I must inform our readers that since dragons are naturally impervious to fire it did not even cross thier minds to put the fire out. It was not out of rudeness or spite, they are just so used to things occassionally burnning down around them that it didnt even register.) </p>

<p>Tinny grabbed the ice bucket and put the fire out. Before anyone could say anything, a grumble reverberated around the room. It was all the dragon’s stomachs growling in unison. The dragons looked at each other, panicked.</p>

<p>The Kid rushed over to the kitchen recycling bin and grabbed an empty salsa container. He looked at it, then squinted at it and then he turned to the dinosaurs and yelled something. They could not hear him over the rumbling. Rogue who apparently was great at reading human lips said it looks like he’s yelling for us to get out. Get out? Penelope said we just got here. Then it happened. All the dragons started to belch out streams of fire.</p>
