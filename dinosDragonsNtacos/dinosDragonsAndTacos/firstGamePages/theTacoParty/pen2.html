<h1>Off to the Party!</h1>

<p>Penelope arrived at the party just a little confused. This was defiantly not Tom Kaneâ€™s house, but things seemed to be jumping off inside. She decided a party is a party and she was still going to be the life of whatever party she ended up at.</p>

<p> Penelope stopped on the steps to text Katie before she went inside and when she looked up she saw that a few other Dinosaurs had arrived, none of which were in 80s attire. Rude she said aloud to herself, but really she was very nervous. As many parties as she had attended she had never attended a party with other dinosaurs.</p>

<p> In fact she didnt socilize with dinosaurs that she wasnt related to ever. Internally she secretly hoped that this party wasnt full of dinosaurs, but externally she was determined to be the life of the party. So Penelope applied a fresh coat of gloss, gave her hair a final tease, and put her gameface on.</p>
