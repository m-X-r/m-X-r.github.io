<h1>TINY THE T REX,</h1>

<p>In name and in stature just turned 19 a week ago. Since his is a summer birthday he spent it at home with his parents, not doing much. His aunt bought him a present and his mom made his favorite dinner. His dad bought a cake from the local bakery and his older brother and sister called from their homes out of state to sing him happy birthday. But all his friends were gone for the summer. It was only a few months until he started college and most his friends were going to school out of state.</p>

<p>Tiny really wanted a big something special to commemorate not only his new year of life starting but also this new period in his life, leaving high school and transitioning to something new. Still, everyone did the best they could to make his day as special as they could and he really appreciated that. Days after his birthday Tiny spent his time playing the new video game his parents and aunt had collectively gave him and taking lazy walks through the neighborhood.</p>

<p>At the end of one of those lazy walks he happen to see the mailman driving off as he walked closer to his house. He waved at the mailman and then went to check the mail. Inside the mailbox Tiny saw a sales paper for the local grocery story and something else. It was a fancy looking envelope shaped like a taco. It had a wax seal closing it with the letters TK engraved into the wax. And better than anything else it was addressed to him.</p>

<p>Who could have possibly sent him this awesome invitation?</p>

<p>Tiny carefuly opens the wax seal and slides a paper taco out. On the taco card is printed the day, time, and place, of a taco party Tiny has been invited to. As he waits for the day of the party he gets more and more nervous thinking about it. On the day of the party as Tiny gets dressed he feels very confident.</p>

<p>Tinny is wearing his cool guy hat to the party. It’s an old cowboy hat that his grandad used to wear that has been passed down through all the men of the family. The has is brown leather, smooth from being worn in for over a decade.</p>

<p>Tiny checks himself one last time in the mirror and then he’s off.</p>
