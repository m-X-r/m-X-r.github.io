<h1>HANKREE THE T REX</h1>

<p>Was middle-aged, he had just celebrated his 40th birthday a few weeks ago. He worked as a trash collector, and he loved it. He came from a long line of trash collectors, including his dad, his granddad, and his greatgrand dad. Even still his great great grandma and his grandma on his moms side, his mom chose to marry a trash collector instead. Multiple generations of Hankree's family had collected trash in his town.</p>

<p>Hankree was also a hobbiest handyman and welder, so when he saw something interesting that someone had thrown out he would take it home and make it better. When he was a child, his dad would bring him all sorts of stuff to tinker with and he made all kinds of things even then. Among his accompishments Hankree had made a soft serve ice coffee machine, that only served iced coffee ice cream, and a pair of headphones that played the song that you were thinking of but couldn't quite remember. He was generally a happy and creative dinosaur, except for one thing.</p>

<p>Hankree tended to get caught up in his work, which lead to bouts of hangry-ness aka bad-tempered or irritable-ness due to intense hunger. When hangry, Hankree tended to go on rampages where he would look for food, specifically humans, and destroy property. After the first 30 or so rampages, Hankree's neigbors developed a system. By the time they got to the 45th rampage they had the system down, and could ususally get Hankree a sandwich before he got out of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Before the system Hankree would make a direct bee line for any nearby human neighborhood, as he thought humans were delicious. About a year ago Hankree evaded the neghborhood hank watch system and he got out the Dino Neighborhood and into a human neighborhood. The first human he ran into was a kid named Hal and his dog. Hankree tried to eat Hal, his dog, and Hal's parents, but Hal got the upperhand on Hankree. Hankree apologized and helped clean up all the property damage he had caused. Afterwards Hals mom made them all spaghetti.  Hal and Hankree were fast friends after that.</p>

<p>Hal started to visit Hankree regularly in his Dino Neighborhood, and he always brought enough spaghetti for everyone, so Hankree started becoming hangry less and less. Hal, his mom, dad, and dog became such regulars to the Dino Neighborhood that were always VIP guest to every Dino Block Party.</p>

<p>One day Hankree took off work early, he had found a broken TV console on his route and he was super excited to start transforming it into a pinball machine. As he rushed to his door overwhelmed with excitement he ran into the mailman, dropping his console. The mailman apologized but Hankree assured him that dropping the console only helped his process. The mail man handed Hankree his mail and wished him luck on his project, strongly encouraging him to eat something before he started working. Taking the mailmans advice hankree heated up some leftover spaghetti and sat down to look through his mail. After throwing out the junk mail Hankree saw a fancy looking envelope shaped like a taco.</p>

<p>It had a wax seal closing it with the letters TK engraved into the wax. Looks like I have been invited to a taco party Hankree said to himself. But then again, Hankree started, I dont know who TK is, how does he know me, why would he inite me to a party? Guess I have to go to find out. With that Hankree noted the date on his calandar and his pocket schedulaer and got to work on his pinball machine.</p>

<p> The day of the party Hankree was sure to wear his best shirt, take his best messenger bag, and fill it with all his most impressive notebooks along with his emergency tinkering kit. As he left the neighborhood he assured everyone that he had eaten and that he would try to bring back some Tacos for them to try, or get the recipie so that Hals mom could make tacos at their next Block Party. As many hangry fits as hankree had had neither him or his neighbors had ever had tacos and everyone wanted to try one. </p>
