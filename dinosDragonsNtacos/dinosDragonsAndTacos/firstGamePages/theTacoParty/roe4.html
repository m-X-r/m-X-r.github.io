<h1> Rouge starts crying!</h1>

<p>She was not crying because there was smoke in her eyes, but because of her ill luck. Why would she be invited to a party by a potential friend of Mary’s only for only living potential connection to Mary to tragically expire as well. Overwrought with grief Rouge extended her arms out, ready to embrace her impending demise. I’m coming to join you! She yelled skyward, hoping Mary would keep a seat warm for her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she was grabbed from behind. She was so shocked that she didn’t have time to react before she was dragged outside. She fell with a hard thud next to another body. She caught her breath and turned to see that it was Tiny, he saved her. She was so overcome with emotions that she grabbed him giving him the biggest hug ever, and cried softly onto his shoulder. </p>
