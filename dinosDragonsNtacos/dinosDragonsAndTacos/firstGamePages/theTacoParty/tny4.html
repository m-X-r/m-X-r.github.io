<h1>Tiny, rushing into action!</h1>

<p>Tiny ran towards the kitchen ducking the flames. He looked around the refrigerator for a fire extinguisher, because that’s where his family kept theirs. But apparently the Kid did things different because he didn’t find one. The smoke began to thicken and Tiny knew it was time to go.</p>

<p>As he rushed towards the door he heard something and turned back. Just barley through the smoke he saw Rouge standing in the same spot as before the fire. She had her arms out and seemed to be yelling at the ceiling. Tiny didn’t know why someone would yell at a fire for being a fire, but that didn’t matter. He rushed over to her and grabbed her arms and begin dragging her out the door with him.</p>

<p>Tiny cleared the steps before he ran out of energy and fell to the ground along with Rouge. Before he could catch his breath, Rouge had him in a full embrace, he could feel her tears soak into his shirt.</p>
