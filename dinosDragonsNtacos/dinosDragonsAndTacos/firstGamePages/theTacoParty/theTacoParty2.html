<h1>The Taco Party!</h1>

<p>Once Tiny walked inside and closed the door he ran into Hankree. The group had stopped at the door, even Penelope was speechless. They looked out onto a rocking party. Correction, A rocking Dragon party!</p>

<p>None of the Dinosaurs had that much experience around Dragons and they all were a little taken aback. True to what seemed to be her form Penelope snapped out of the daze first. She straightened her skirt, pumped up her hair and turned back to the group and yelled,“don’t worry, I’m an expert when it comes to fitting into new species group!" With that she grabbed the nearest dragon and started a conversation. Before the dragon could respond a young human boy holding a dog with shades and a gold chain on inturrupted her.</p>

<p>“Hi, welcome to my party, I'm The Kid and I'm super ecstatic that yall could make it.  I Hope you didn't have any problems finding the place.” The Kid yelled.</p>
