<h1>ROUGE THE RAPTOR,</h1>

<p>Grew up under the tutelage of a human. She was raised as a pet, think of a cat, only with a raptor. Despite not having a lot of social time with other dinosaurs Rouge loved her life, and her human, Mary. When Mary and Rogue met Rogue was 1 and Mary was 28. Rogue and Mary spend 60 years together, wonderful years but then Mary passed away and Rogue remained.</p>

<p>Saddened by her Mary's death and having lived 61 years without developing any other meaningful connections, Rouge was moved into a group home for abandoned dinosaurs. She preferred to stay in Marys house, but the house was being sold and she had nowhere else to go. When Rouge first got to the Dino Home, she was very sad all the time and barely left her room. It was a year before she would come out and mingle in the social hall with the other abandoned dinosaurs for a bit.</p>

<p> One day while Rouge was sitting in her room flipping thru an old photo album she heard a knock at the door. She looked up to see an orderly, his name was Max. Rogue liked Max because he was fine with her being quiet and secluded. He never pushed her to talk or do anything other than what she was doing. Max told her he stopped by because she had gotten some mail. She never went down to mail call, because she never got mail so this was interesting. He handed her an envelope.  It was a fancy looking envelope shaped like a taco. It had a wax seal closing it with the letters TK engraved into the wax, and it was addressed to her. Who could have sent this she wondered admiring the envelope?  Rogue was very surprised about how gitty she had gotten about this mystery party invite. She hadn’t felt excited about anything since Mary passed. She was enjoying the feeling but she also felt a little guilty for enjoying it, because Mary could not enjoy it as well. The day the party she put on her best party dress Mary’s favorite perfume one of Mary’s favorite necklaces.</p>
