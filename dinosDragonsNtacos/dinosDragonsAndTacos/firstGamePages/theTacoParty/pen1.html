<h1>PENNELOPE THE TEENAGE T REX, </h1>

<p> Is16 and living her best life. She is a sophmore at a majority human high school. Other than humans they have Pennelope and a brown bear named Rosco. Rosco transfered straight from his forest school to this once because his dad got a new job and they had to move. Rosco is not adjusting well, but since Pennelope has been in school with humans since elementry school she has learned to not only survive but thrive at her all human school. </p>

<p>The last time Pennelope had trouble fitting in was when she was in the first grade and just starting school. She found humans to be delicious so she kept trying to eat all her classmates. Luckly, she didnt have all her teeth in yet and could only swallow them so she was able to spit them out after trying to eat them. All her classmates were "eaten" and they all came out unharmed, except for the dino spit and the emotional trauma of being swallowed. No matter how hard she tried, she could not stop herself from eating her classmates. That is until one day her tail got to close to the goldfish bowl and the goldfish tried to eat her. Goldfish dont have teeth so Pennelope was unharmed, except for the goldfish spit and the emotional trauma of being tasted. Up unitl that point no one knew that some goldfish find T Rexe's delicious. After that experience Pennelope and her classmates bonded over swaping traumatic attempted consumption stories. Pennelope's people cravings also stopped for the most part, anytime she thinks of eating a person now she thinks of goldfish and that nips that craving in the bud.</p>

<p> At her high school Penelope has become quite popular. She tries to reach out to Rosco every now and then to try and help with his tranition, but hes not ready yet. Good thing is that Penelope is presestant and she refuses to give up on him. Her persistance has helped her alot at school. She makes good grades, she is a cheerleader and the top gymnast in school, and she has plenty of friends. In fact Penelope is somewhat of an "it" girl at her school.</p>

<p>This school year Danny Sanders, senior, captain of the football team, and the best-looking guy in school invited her to the Junior Prom. One evenning after gymastic team practice she was searching online for the perfect prom dress when she got a text. Her best friend Katie was telling her about a party that was going to happen at Tom Kaneâ€™s house. Tom was a sophomore but he came from a wealthy family and was always throwing rowdy parties because his parents were always gone. All the cool kids went to Toms parties, so she was a little miffed at hearing he was having another one and she was not invited. Before she could get too mad, Katie told her that Tom had sent out a bunch of invitations in the mail, so retro. The theme was 80's Baby and encouraged Pennelope to start checking the mail, as there was absolutely no way she would not get an invite to this party.</p>

<p> For the  next few weeks Penelope religously checked the mail. For her it was a weird experience. She knew what mailboxes were and what they were for but she had never actually "checked the mail" or even sent a letter. The more she thought about it Penelope realized that she had never even been to the post office ever. One afternoon during her daily mailbox checking ritual she finally saw what she had been looking for, a fancy looking envelope. It was shaped like a taco, which she found a little strange but assued it was because 80's babies ate tacos. The envelope had a wax seal closing it with the letters TK engraved into the wax. Cute she thought as she took the envelope back upstairs. She immediatly stopped looking for prom dresses online and started doing research on the 80s so she could create the perfect party outfit. Strangly enough she didnt find any info about the connection between the 80s and tacos but she did find a cute neon colored fanny pack. On parties eve she equiped her costume, made her hair extra big, and filled her fanny pack with touch up makeup and scrunchies.</p>
