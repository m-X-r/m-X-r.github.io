<h1>The Taco Party, Tragedy</h1>

<p>Before the dinosaurs could gather themselves The Kid stumbles over. His shirt is covered in soot and his left sleeve was singed. He looked over them and said “I’m glad you guys made it out ok, I’m so sorry about all of this. That was really shaping up to be one of my best parities yet, such a shame.”</p>

<p> Hankree moved in a little closer to The Kid and asked, “do most these parties end in fire or did something go wrong?” The kid assured him that this was not a normal occurrence. He said as far as the dragons go, they are basically fireproof so he knew that they all would be fine. The added fact that all the dinosaurs, his dog, and himself got out in time made thing much better. The Kid told them that other than being impervious to flames Dragons were great carpenders and so even though all the dragons were currently standing in the burnt remains of the house crying, he knew that they would all help him rebuild. Dragons love tacos but they really like helping their friends.</p>

<p> In regards to the specifics of why the dragons started belching fire The Kid was puzzled. It was well known that dragons love tacos, but not spicy salsa as it gave them firery indigestion. Knowing this The Kid always bought mild salsa from the same place, but this is the only party he has had where his house has burned down. The Kid pulled out an empty salsa jar, "I got this out of the recycling bin right before everything went up in flames. Look! It says totally mild salsa, like it always does. I dont understand how this could have happen!"</p>

Hankree put on his glasses and then asked to hold the jar. He looked closely at the label, and then pulled a magnification glass out of his bag. “Look! He exclaimed after a few minutes. “The jar says totally mild salsa, but in extra fine print here it says with now with spicy jalapeno peppers.”</p>

<p>“Jalapeno Peppers!" The Kid exclaimed! "Dragons can’t eat Jalapeno peppers! Who would put those in a totally mild salsa!”</p>

<p>“A mystery is afoot.” Tiny said in his best Sherlock Holmes impression... Only the kid was impressed. “Come on guys!” Tiny continued “Don’t you want to help solve the mystery of the spicy salsa?” </p>
