<p>Once the dinosaurs and Maddy were free, the chief special dragon ops leader walked over to the group. He started to say something but no one could understand what was being said under the helmet. He directed them out of the room flooded with agents and down the hall. As soon as they turned the corner and were out of sight the chief pulled off his helmet. It was the kid in a dragon disguise! "Great job guys, I wouldn't have expected anything less." Everyone including Maddie's mouth dropped. "You are a secret agent," Rouge whispered. "I am a secret agent for the dragons. It was their idea for me to join the special ops unit due to my past career in the special forces. They felt it would be best that I served as a dragon, and I had to get the scientist to create my suit. That's how I met Agent G and then Ada Twist. They knew we would need outside help to crack this case so they had me invite you guys to my part. The best outside unbiased team we could think of that would fit in here and had the collective skills to navigate any hurdles that may come up. Thanks to yall we got the whole conversation on tape. Takeover Drake is going away for a long time." The kid smiled at the group and begin to put his dragonhead back on. Suddenly he stopped, "Maddy, I forgot to mention you are now part of our secret agent team, you will help Ada on the science end to figure out how to reverse what Drake did, you are officially unofficially a scientist to those classified for the clearance to know that. "  He put his head back on and trotted off back towards the boardroom where his men were. "Wow, you are a secret agent scientist. how cool is that" Tinny said patting Maddy on the back. "Thanks, Tinny" Maddy replied, beaming with pride.  "Just another at the office, solving one world problem after the next."  The dinosaurs and Maddy were heading for the front door of TMC Inc surrounded by the haze of smoke and dust still settling from the explosion when a special ops dragon ran up to them. "The chief wanted me to give you all this." He said while pressing an envelope into Penelope's hand. He held on a little too long and squeezed her hand. Penelope squinted to see thru his visor. "Paul?" she whispered. She saw a smirk on his face and he whispered back "I got a new job, talk to you later." and ran off to rejoin the squad. The group waited until they were in the car and then Hankree read the letter aloud.  
"I'm sorry I couldn't let you guys in on what we had planned, as well as any inconvenience that helping us may have caused. You all were determined to be the necessary catalyst for our plans to catch Takeover Drake once and for all. If it's any constellation, my house has been rebuilt, and I will be having a Taco Party tomorrow night, you all should come. Also, you are all now honorary citizens of Dragonland and as soon as the taco crops are back you will get your rightful portion of the daily taco allowance along with bonus all-you-can-eat chips, salsa, queso, and guac for your honorary service. Sincerely The Kid." The car dropped them all off at the Hotel that day. Maddy wanted to hang out and be there to tell Sherral all about their adventures. Tinny even called Ms. Kim over with a giant banana bread request. They stayed up and talked and fellowshipped all night and well into the morning. They went to bed so late that they were almost late for The Kid's party the next day. The party was amazing. but most importantly the dinosaurs got to finally try a taco. After the first bite, they all knew why dragons loved tacos so much, because tacos are DELICIOUS.
