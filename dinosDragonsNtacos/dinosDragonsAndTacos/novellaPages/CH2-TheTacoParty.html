	<h1>Chapter Two: The Taco Party </h1>

	<p>It's the day of the taco party, and all the dinosaurs are getting ready. Tiny decided to wear his "cool guy hat." It's an old cowboy hat that his great great great grandad bought on sale at some store in town that has since become a Starbucks. Tiny's grandad cubed originally bought the hat so he would feel cool enough to ask Tiny's grandmom cubed out on their first date. Since then, as the hat has passed from generation to generation, it has generally become common knowledge that you only wear it when you need to be extra cool. Locally sourced chocolate brown leather that had become soft and smooth while taking on a rugged appearance from being worn in for over a decade would make anyone extra cool.</p> 

<p>Rouge and her hall neighbor Anna made a trip to the mall so that Rouge could buy a new dress. Now getting to the mall from the group home was quite a feat. You had to take two buses, a cab, another bus and then the train. It would take them all day to go and come back, so they decided to make the most of it. They stopped to take pictures at scenic spots, window shopped every chance they got, they even had a mukbang in the mall food court with their table neighbors. Rouge took Mary's necklaces with her to the mall. She wanted to find a dress to match it. Mary used to wear that necklace every single day. It was a large stone consisting of a mixed myriad of blues inside a silver frame and hung on a silver chain. Rouge went to the mall, intending to find a blue dress to match. With Anna's help, she ended up with a burnt orange dress that complimented the necklace better than any blue dress ever could. They even found shoes to match, blue ones that helped the necklace "POP!" Rouge, not being great at social situations, was glad to have a piece of Mary to take with her to the party. She was also very grateful that she had a new friend in Anna and was glad to be visiting the mall with her. Once they got back to the group home, Rouge put her purchases away and started making a new scrapbook containing her latest adventures at the group home.</p> 

<p>The day Penelope had to research, but she ended up with what she considered the perfect retro outfit. It had a real 80s vibe, big hair, leg warmers, even a thrifted dayglow fanny pack. She was planning on using the fanny pack even after the party, as it could fit her cell phone and a travel charger! Penelope was nervous about the party. She had been to a ton of Tom Kane's parties, so she was not anxious about that. Penelope was worried because this was not a Tom Kane party. A few days after the finishing touch for her outfit, an actual walkman with a cassette tape arrived. Penelope received Tom Kane's 80's baby party invite in the mail. At that moment, though, Penelope was unsure about who T.K. and his taco-shaped invite were. Still, she became determined to use this party as a test run for her outfit's style-ability and party functionality.  If nothing else, Penelope was the queen of every party she attended and had every intention to keep her reign afloat. One problem, though, she had no idea who all was going to be at this party. How could Penelope smooze without background info! Penelope cold-called a party last when she first started human school. That didn't go over well, and she had no desire to revisit that experience. She decided she needed a backup plan, so she ordered a mini encyclopedia of regional persons, creatures, and otherwise sentient otherthings. It arrived the day before T.K.'s party and fit perfectly into her fanny pack.   She was now ready to rule T.K.'s party like the party queen that she was.</p>

<p>The day before T.K.'s party Hankree spent his day prepping. He was excited about the party, but he had to remember he was on a mission. That mission being, acquire the local favorite taco recipe. If the said recipe was a secret, acquire any taco recipe. He wanted to be sure he remained prepared to document any taco cooking experience. Hence, he packed his camera, a tape recorder, two blank journals, three journals full of his cooking and test recipe notes, his reading glasses, throat lozenges for extended talk sessions, extra batteries for his tape recorder, and ducktape.  He also remembered to pick up his dry cleaning to look presentable for the food, I mean party.
The only parties Hankree usually went to were block parties, so He was unsure how people would react to him at this T.K. Taco Party. Hankree knew that he usually came off as a party killer. He didn't like to dance, so instead, he would start conversations with party-goers. He talked about facts and statistics and mechanical engineering stuff more than fun party things, which usually did not interest his fellow party-goers. He once tried to research fun things to talk about at parties, but his results were inconclusive. So he reached out and asked everyone around him what "fun" things to talk about at parties were. His coworkers told him to talk about the finer details of trash collection, which always went well at parties they attended. His neighbors said he should bring up party planning details for neighborhood block parties, as that was what they talked about at their parties. Hal, on the other hand, told him not to do any of that. Then he gave Hankree a plastic cube full of tiny cards. Each card had a "conversation starter" written on it, but to Hankree, it just looked like a random thing to say. Hal assured him that if he would just pull a new card each time he talked to a party-goer, he would succeed at being a cool party-goer. Hankree trusted Hal the most, so he made sure to take a stack of cards from the cube and put them in his pocket. While also making room in his satchel for the cube containing the rest of the cards. He did have to remove all three notebooks containing his culinary research. Still, he figured being a big hit at the party could be exponentially better than sharing his culinary research in his mission to obtain that taco recipe.</p>

<p>All the dinos arrived at the same time. Their respective Ubers, Lyfts, Yellow Cabs, and in Hankrees case, a garbage truck arrived in front of T.K.'s modest-sized home. It had a dirt yard and a giant boat full of taco remnants out front. They could see party lights strobing and hear the base of some party song playing inside. The dinosaurs had never met before that night, but each one was happy not to be the only dinosaur at the party. Standing outside T.K.'s home was a small group of dragons. As the dinosaurs got out of their vehicles, they saw the dragons munching on something before they walked inside. Tiny started the awkward introductions as the dinosaurs stood around the front porch steps looking at each other and shifting from foot to foot. "Hi, I'm Tiny, in name and stature. Yall ready for this party?" </p>
<p>Penelope was the first to speak up. "I was born ready! Penelope is the name, and parties are my game! Well, parties are not all I do, but it sounded nice, right." At this point, Rouge jumped into the conversation. "Penelope, that sounded great. You seem to be a very energetic young lady. I, on the other hand, am a very mild-mannered old lady." Rouge laughed at her joke. "I'm Rouge, by the way, your resident old lady raptor." Rouge laughed some more, as did the rest of the group. Hankree stepped closer to the center of the group at this point. "Hi, I'm Hankree, resident tinkerer, junk collector, and future taco recipe holder. I would also like to add Ms. Rouge that I consider you resident raptor extraordinaire because you don't look a day over 35." Hankree said that last part with a wink, causing Rouge to blush. Tiny decided to rally the troops at this point. "Now that we're all friends Let's Party!" With that, he motioned for everyone to make their way up the stairs and into the party.</p>

<p>As they walked inside, they were overwhelmed with loud dance music and strobing party lights. As their eyes adjusted to the light, they could see, milling about, all the party-goers. Some were dancing, and some were flying. Some were eating and drinking, while others were laughing and kidding around. To the dinosaurs, the thing that stood out the most was that all the party-goers were dragons. They were impressed and surprised at just how many full-sized dragons could fit in the modest home. The only thing more abundant than dragons at the party were tacos. So Many Tacos! The Dinos were just amazed by just how many tacos fit into the house, along with all the dragons. While the group just stood and stared in aw Hankree suddenly started yelling to be heard over the music. "Isn't it amazing? There are so many dragons eating so many tacos at such an astounding rate. Yet, the supply of tacos does not seem to be affected by the rate at which they are consumed. Astounding!" Before any of the dinosaurs could reply, a young boy with a dog walked up to them.</p>

<p>"Hi!" The boy yelled so that the dinosaurs could hear him over the music. "Welcome to my party, I'm The Kid, but everyone calls me T.K. for short.  I'm so glad that yall could make it out. I hope you didn't have any problems finding the place." Hankree was just about to expound the merits of GPS to The Kid when pandemonium broke out.</p>
