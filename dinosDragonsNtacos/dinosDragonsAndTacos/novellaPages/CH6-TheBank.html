	<h1>Chapter Six: The Bank </h1>

<p>The following day the group woke up early. They had all set their alarms to ensure they got up early enough to get to the bank on time. 7 am on the dot. All the dinosaurs were huddled in the hallway, preparing to head out. Only Hankree was missing. As the dinosaurs made their way out into the lobby, they found Hankree sipping coffee at a breakfast buffet table.  With all these papers and open notebooks spread out all around him. As he was taking a sip of coffee, he happened to see them approaching. "Oh, hi. About time you guys woke up."</p>

<p>Hankree informed the group that he had been researching DragonLand. Sherral had helped by providing old documentation. Apparently, the hotel had just about every copy of the town's newspaper. The hotel had started ordering them for guests, but the custodial staff developed a tradition of keeping a copy. Something about an inside joke the custodial staff refused to share with everyone else.  What the newspapers left out Hankree obtained from Sherral via oral history as she was born and raised in DragonLand, like most dragons. He had also been drafting a map, as most dragons were native to DragonLand, and as dragons have excellent spatial memory.  None of them ever needed a map as they knew where everything was.  In addition, DragonLand didn't have much in the way of the hospitality industry.  It seems that dragons had a terrible stigma attached to them. In most cultures, they are portrayed as very angry, with their biggest desire being to set fire to people and property alike. They were also "known" to eat people, steal valuable shiny objects, and sit atop them in a pile. Hankree could not imagine why people would say those things about dragons, seeing as how all the dragons he had met were quite lovely. At that moment, Sherral walked in with a fresh pot of coffee. "Hey, guys, about time you woke up. If you leave now, you should get to the bank right when it opens. Did you get the map Hankree drew? He's so talented." As she talked, she poured Hankree some fresh coffee and gave him a wink and a nudge. Hankree smiled at Sherral and then handed Tiny the map. "Here you go, fresh off the presses. It should take you guys an hour to walk into town, and It's 7:30 ish now. The bank opens at 9:00, so you guys should make it well within time to be the first in line. If you make it back here before 12, Sherral doesn't get into trouble for letting us stay the night. So be sure to be back before 12, now get going!"</p>

<p>Tiny, Rouge, and Penelope made their way out of the hotel lobby and into the street. Besides loaning them a room for the night, Sherral had also found Penelope and Rouge some shoes made more for walking than the ones they wore to the party. "Sherral is the best!" Penelope shouted once they got into the street. Tiny and Rouge quickly agreed with her. Tiny then glanced over at the Taco Cave and noticed it was open for breakfast. "Taco Cave is open; maybe we can finally try a taco!" "How are we going to do that? We don't have any Taco Change remember."
Penelope said, "That's the whole reason we are going to the bank." Rouge added. Tiny stood up a little straighter and put his hands on his hips. "I get that, but if Bart, Paul, or Jackie is still there, I'm sure they will hook us up." Rouge and Penelope thought about what Tiny said for a moment, and then they said, "Good point, let's go." in unison. As soon as the group made it to the door, they saw Jackie waving and then motioning for them to come around to the drive-thru. "Hey, guys, glad Bart's aunt could hook you up with a room. On your way to the bank?" "We sure are," Tiny said, leaning against the side of the window. "Hey, you think you could hook us up with a breakfast taco? We will pay you back plus some when we get back." Jackie just laughed.</p>

<p>"No can do, new friend. I'm on my way out, and the day manager will not have any of that. The morning rush starts in about 30 minutes, and it's a monster. If you guys hold up for a second, I will meet you in the back, and we can walk some of the way to the bank together. My house is heading that way." The dinosaurs agreed, and in no time at all, Tiny, Rouge, Penelope, and Jackie were walking towards town, talking and joking.  Jackie was waving goodby to the dinosaurs in no time at all while he turned left to walk the rest of the way home. "Just keeping going straight, the bank is only two more blocks down." It was 8:45 am, and the dinosaurs were glad to be ahead of schedule. Tiny was standing in front of the door while Rouge and Penelope sat on the curb as the bank security guard came to open the door at 9:01 am.
"Early birds, I hope worms are all yall are planning on catching today," he said to them as he held open the door for the dinosaurs to walk inside. Tinny assured him that they wanted no trouble and rushed to greet the bank teller. "Hello Mam, how are you today? We just wanted to exchange some of our dinosaur money for some Taco Change if that's alright." The teller clutched at her pearl necklace and stared at Tiny "Now I'll be! I haven't come across such a polite young man in a barrel full of days past Sunday. Where are you from young man?"</p>

<p>Tiny and the bank teller, whose name turned out to be Ms. Kim, to everyone but Tiny, who was encouraged to call her Mama Kim.  During Tiny and Ms. Kims conversation, Penelope discovered that the bank chairs had USB charging ports conveniently placed within the arms, so she was busy seeing what was new on TickTock.
Rouge found herself in a bank manager's office discussing Roth IRAs. None of the dinosaurs noticed how close to 10:45 it was until they heard a giant sneeze. They all snapped out of what they were doing to stare at the source, which was the security guard. "What? Dragons have allergies, Achoo! "Some allergies," Penelope said under her breath.  Suddenly Rouge shouted as she rushed out of the bank manager's office, knocking some things off his desk as she rushed by. "Guys, we have to go! We are going to be late!" Mama Kim told Tiny, "Take you some nibbles for the road." as she handed him some homemade bread along with his Taco Change. Penelope saw the exchange and said, "nice, can I have some of that?" Ms. Kim just redirected her to the candy dish on the bank's deposit slip island. As the trio scattered out of the bank, Tiny turned and shouted. "Bye Yall! Thanks for the hospitality." to which Ms. Kim just let out a deep sigh and said, "Oh, what a polite young man."</p>

<p>The trio rushed back towards the hotel. It was like a race with them all cycling through bouts of sprinting, walking, fast walking, and pausing to catch their breath. The hustling paid off as they made it back to the hotel at 11:35 am, a whole ten minutes ahead of schedule. They all paused at the hotel welcome sign to catch their breath, but before they could make their way inside the hotel, the Taco Cave went up in flames.</p>

<p>They all just stood staring with their mouths agapae as fire consumed the restaurant. As the fire grew in size and intensity, the dragons did not panic. Rouge figured it was because dragons are fireproof, as they had learned the last time a building burned down around them.  The dragons inside the restaurant and those waiting in the walk-through line just made their way over to the hotel parking lot to watch the flames. The ones that had made it out with their taco supplies clutched their bags close. The rest, who didn't get their orders, or those who came from inside and only had the burnt remains of their orders, just wept softly, just like the dinosaurs.</p>

<p> Before the dinosaur trio realized it, Hankree and Sheral were standing beside them. Penelope looked at Sheral with tears in her eyes, "we got your Taco Change. Sorry, we were late." Sheral gave Penelope a big hug and told her everything was going to be alright. </p>
