	<h1>Chapter Five: Taco Cave </h1>

	<p>The Dinosaurs started their journey towards "the light," as they had started calling it. As there are no streetlights in DragonLand, the road was quite dark along the way. When they first started walking, Penelope used her phone to light the way and play some mood music. After about 45 minutes, her phone was at 10% battery life. "How much longer do we have to go! I need some juice!" Penelope wined as she turned off her flashlight and music and put her phone away. Hankree guessed it wasn't much longer, but as he had already supposed that same thought 20 minutes beforehand, no one believed him. After about 20 more minutes of walking, they finally saw it, the storefront attached to the glowing sign. They were all saddened to see it was, in fact, not a gas station or a store. It was The Taco Cave, a taco drive-thru restaurant. They were more saddened to learn that the restaurant had run out of tacos 45 minutes prior and that they were only still open because they had plenty of drinks and taco fixings. All the Taco Caves in DragonLand made most there money off selling taco fixings in bulk through the drive-thru window. As they very often sold out of all the available complete tacos quite quickly, but to be fair, it would be hard for anyone to be able to keep up with DragonLand taco demand. After "dining room" hours, the Dinosaurs had to chat with the late-night shift employees through the Drive-Thru window. The staff consisted of two teen dragons, Jackie and Paul: high school sophomores and juniors, respectively, and one older teen dragon, Bart, who had just graduated from high school.  Paul was the one who told them about not having any tacos, and when they tried to get drinks, Jackie was the one that let them know that their money was wrong. Luckily Bart gave them all a drink on the house after they told them about the taco party. "Wow, man, I was supposed to go to that party. I just couldn't get my shift covered. Totally Mild Spicy Salsa, that's really messed up." Bart said as he handed them drinks through the window. "You guys wouldn't happen to know where TotallyMildSalsa Inc Headquarters and Manufacturer is, would you? Google said it was in town."</p>

<p>Tiny asks the trio as they sipped their tasty beverages. The three dragons just looked at each other quizzically. "The Google also said it was at 466 NotSusAtAll Lane. Do you know where that street is?" Rouge added. "NotSusAtAll Lane! I know where that is. We like to practice skate tricks out there." Paul shouted, "It just seemed like an old long road, though. We've never seen any buildings out there. My skate crew and I are the only ones in town who hang out there, and I bet we have walked further down that road than anyone else in town. If you are going to go exploring down there, you guys are definitely going to need some wheels." "Can you, as the kids say, hook us up, young man?" Hankree inquired. "Of course, you guys seem cool, and any friend of The Kid is a friend of mine. Plus, the perks of being part of a skate club, is that we have a lot of extra gear between all of us. Tell you what, give me two days, and I will have a map drawn up for you along with all the gear you will need."</p>

<p>"Deal!" Tinny shouted. "Oh, Paul, what am I going to do with you" Penelope added with a wink that made Paul blush.  "You guys should go to the bank downtown and see if they will exchange your funny money for Taco Change," Jackie added. "Oh no," Rouge said, "if we don't have the money they take here, how will we find a place to rest for the night?" "I got that! My aunt runs the hotel right across the way there." Bert said, pointing across the street. I'll text her, and she will let you guys stay for the night, but you have to go to the bank first thing!"</p>

<p>The dinosaurs waved goodbye to the dragon trio as they walked over to the hotel. When they walked inside, a friendly lady dragon greeted them. "Hi, I'm Sherral, you guys looking for a room for the night? We have plenty, along with the softest sheets in town and a complimentary taco breakfast. Mind you, that breakfast has a strict two breakfast taco limit." Sherral then whispered, "It used to be a taco buffet, but that got out of control quickly." Hankree pushed through his dino pals to get to the front desk. "Nice to meet you, Sherral," he said, with a slightly shaky tone. "You must be Bert's Aunt. I'm Hankree, its so nice to meet you finally." He leaned onto the counter and stared at Sherral with a very goofy look on his face as he said that. "Yeah, finally, after we just found out that you existed less than ten minutes ago across the street at the Taco Cave," Penelope added with a sigh. "Mam, Bert said that you could maybe rent us a room for the night on credit, and we can pay you back in the morning as soon as we get back from the bank. All we have is Dino Bucks, but it seems the only currency taken here is Taco Change." Sherral thought for a second and then looked at Hankree, still ogling her from the counter. "Is that right, Hankree?"
Sherral asked, tapping Hankree's forearm. </p>

<p>Hankree only mumbled something indistinguishable and leaned into the counter further. " I guess I can set you guys up for the night, just be sure to go to the bank first thing and leave Re-Re here with me. You know as collateral," she smiled and winked at Hankree. "Is it alright if I call you Re-Re?" Hankree mumbled something that sounded like you can call me whatever you like or sounds like marshmellow kite, and Sherral handed Penelope two room keys. "One room will be for the boys and one room for the girls. All things being equal, you may have the room to yourself tonight, young man. I think Re-Re might stay here with me all night." At that, Hankree started nodding a lot and mumbling some more.  After such a long day, all the dinosaurs were tired and sleepy, and they all wished Hankree and Sherral a good night and headed off to bed. Tiny dreamed of the journey to the bank the next day, while Rouge dreamed of solving the spicy salsa mystery. Penelope dreamed of finding a cell phone charger, and Hankree, when he finally made his way to bed, dreamed of Sherral.</p>
