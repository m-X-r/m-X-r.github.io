	<h1>Chapter Nine: The Meeting </h1>

<p>Inside the room was a small window and a small desk. Sitting behind the small desk was a small dragon. He stood up and walked around to the front of the desk. He had shades, a black bowler hat, a tourist t-shirt, and some beach shorts with flip-flops.  He smiled and said, "hello again young lady, glad you took my advice." Penelope put her hand on her hip and said "Ummm, we have never met random dragon man." Then Rouge pushed past her smiling, "I knew I didn't make you up, how are you." They embraced hands and the man replied "I'm doing better than your hotel manager friend, how is she?" at this Hankree spoke up, "what about Sherall? How do you know her?" The man, unsure about why Hankree was so upset told everyone he didn't know this Sherall he just was leaving the hotel as a crowd of Dragons in Taco withdrawal were yelling at her. Ada broke up the story to bring the conversation back to TMS inc. Tiny gave the TMS inc speil and explained what they discovered after the party went up in flames. the man and Ada looked at each other and then back at the group. The man addressed everyone. "I am agent G, I am working with the scientist to figure out what is going on with the taco crops and I enlisted Ada Twist to come and help on that end. During our investigation, we found that TMS Inc seems to be flooding the supply chain with secretly spicy Salsa. We also suspect that they have something to do with the failing taco crops, but we have yet to find the connection or cause. Ada spoke up then " I have a hypothesis about that. TMS inc has not been in town that long at all. They moved in about Three years ago. I'm not sure how they happen to push the local salsa barons out but they took over all the export of Salsa. Right around the time that the tri-annual Salsa fest was gearing up."  Hankree interrupted "Triannual?" followed by Tiny "Salsa fest!" Ada waited for the room to settle and then continued "Every three years or tri-annually (that's not how years work Hankree mumbled) the people of Dragonland have a festival. It's like a giant salsa cookoff. only no one eats any of the Salsa that is made, because dragons are terrible at making Salsa. The whole point of the event is to remind everyone why all the Salsa is exported from outside of Dragonland." Rouge raised her hand to ask a question. "If they don't eat it, what happens to all the Salsa cooked?"  Ada, glad that Rouge raised her hand answered "all the salsa prepared is buried in a large pit that is then set aflame serving as the bonfire to light up the giant taco party that takes place. They have a giant custom salsa jar made just for this occasion that all the imported Salsa is dumped into. There is a museum across town dedicated to the display of these jars and photos from previous festivals. Here in Dragonland, they make a new jar every festival from a good portion of all the recycled jars over the previous 3 years." Penelope, obviously bored interrupted "So what's any of this got to do with TMS inc?" Ada turned and walked to the back wall of the small room and flipped a switch on the wall. The wall rolled up revealing a giant cork board. There were papers pinned to the board and varying strings creating a bit of a web going across the wall and back. On the strings were more attached bits of paper. There was even a giant ladder that you can move across the width of the board so you can reach every inch. Ada pulled out a laser pointer from her pocket. and begin to start a speech when Penelope stopped her. "Yeah no, can you just lay out the main point because we don't have time for whatever this is about to be."  Ada gave Penelope a look while putting her laser pointer away. "Three years ago at the tri-annual Salsa fest, TMS inc took over the import of Salsa for Dragonland. Before that, there were three main import companies but slowly they got bought out without too many people noticing. They didn't fire anyone they just acquired the businesses silently. So at the time of the Fest TMS inc was providing all the Salsa for the event. Everything seemed to go off without a hitch. I interviewed every dragon that was at the event, and everyone said everything was in order except for one observer. A young dragon named Tim, 10 years old at the time. Tim said that he was playing kick the rock around the giant pit that had been dug for the bonfire. He miscalculated his kick and his rock flew into the pit, but he heard it hit something metal. He went to investigate and could have sworn he saw a metal pipe near the bottom wall of the pit. Right before he could process what he thought he saw his parents called to come watch the judging of the contest. I tried to interview the digger of the pit for that year, but for whatever reason, I cannot seem to find him. He allegedly moved the day after the fest but has no forwarding info. I think TMS inc put a metal pipe in that hole but I dont know to what end. I also think the Kid has been suspecting TMS inc and wanted some outsider's opinions which is why I think he invited you all." the room grew silent. "But why us?" Tinny inquired. "That I'm not sure about" Ada replied. "So what do we do now?" Hankree asked Ada. </p>
