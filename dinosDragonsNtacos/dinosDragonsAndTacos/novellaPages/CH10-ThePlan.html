	<h1>Chapter Ten: The Plan </h1>

<p>Agent G laied out a plan. The scientist had been trying to get the Mayor to give them a VIP pass to have a tour at the TMS inc plant for months now but he would not. Agent G figured since it is very rare that other species come to Dragon land that the Mayor may make an exception for the Dinosaurs. They just had to schedule an appointment with his secretary. "So," Agent G said, "The mayor's secretary works remotely you can find her at the bank and her name is Kim" Tiny started jumping up and down yelling Mama Kim, Mama Kim over and over. Agent G  looked flabbergasted, not in on the dinosaur's trip to the bank.  "Ok, settle down now son" Hankree insisted. "What do we do next?" he asked Agent G. "Next you want to go on a tour with Maddy, let's say she's your Dragon Ambassador. She will have a hidden camera on her and an earpiece with me and Ada looking in telling her what to look for and what to say to help our investigation. She will also try to covertly communicate to you all what we are saying. Right Maddy?" Everyone turned to look at Maddy who was blushing at this point "Right" she squeaked out.  Ada and Agent G fitted Maddy out in her spy gear and then the dinos and Maddy headed off to the bank. </p>

<p> When they arrived at the bank it was close to close but not quite. Tiny rushed in to greet Mama K. When everyone else got inside they were hugging and Kim was going on and on about how she missed her boy so much. She was shoving a mini loaf of banana bread towards Tiny's mouth when Hankree interrupted.  "Sorry, but we had some Mayoral business to discuss with you, Ms. Kim." Kim put the loaf down on her desk. "Oh really, you don't say, well let me put my Mayoral hat on." Then she proceeded to reach under her desk and pull out what could only be described as a Mayoral hat. It was fancy, like something you would wear at an inauguration, or a wedding, or a funeral. It was white with feathers and shear netting decorating it. There were sequins and pearls, and mirrors. Ms. Kim even had a fancy hat pin to affix it to her hair. "Now that that's settled what Maryoral business do you have for me?" She asked with a smirk. "Well..." Hankree was thrown off by the grandeur of the Mayoral hat and started to stutter. Between chewing Tiny jumped in. "We need, (chew chew) we need VIP passes so we can take a tour of the TMS plant. We have never seen a salsa plant and we thought... (chew chew) this is so good Mama K! We thought we should see one while we are here. Can I get the recipe for this?"  Mama K pondered the request for one second then shouted out "Approved! For the tour, not the banana bread. If I give you the recipe you will never come to see me she said pinching Tiny's cheeks. Tinny promised to never NOT come and see Ms. Kim as she certified a VIP pass for the group and Maddy. The group thanked Ms. Kim as she hugged Tiny goodbye for now and they headed back to the Taco Institute. When they got back Maddy took them through the back staff entrance, as it was after hours. They met back up with Agent G and Ada and showed them the pass. Ada told them she would get them a private car to take them and Maddy back to their respective homes/hotels and to pick them up in the morning to take them to TMS inc. The car would pick them up at 10 am sharp.hat night Rouge spent a good portion of the evening on the phone with Agent G allegedly going over finer details of the next day's mission. All the other Dinosaurs already knew they just enjoyed each other's company. Penelope hung out at the Taco cave ruins with Paul, Jackie, and Bart. They didn't have jobs at the moment but were so used to being at the Taco Cave that time of day that they still came and just hung out. Hankree of course spent the evening keeping Sheral company. Tiny joined them, he even shared some of his banana bread from Ms. Kim with them. The Dinosaurs chose to spend their nite slightly distracted to not freak out about the "mission" they had the next morning.  In the morning when the car arrived at the hotel Maddy was already inside looking nervous.</p>
