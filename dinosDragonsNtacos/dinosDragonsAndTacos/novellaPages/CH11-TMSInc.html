	<h1>Chapter Eleven: TMS Inc </h1>

<p>It was a quiet drive to TMS Inc. when they pulled up to the building entrance Tiny tried to give everyone a pep talk. "We got this guys! group fist bump." No one bumped a fist with him. They were greeted at the door by a Dragon in a black suit. He was very smiley and polite, but something seemed off about him. He confirmed their VIP pass and then he invited them inside. "I didn't realize you all would have a dragon ambassador with you" he mentioned offhand as they walked down the main hall. Hankree spoke up, "we felt it would be best to  ensure we don't offend you as we don't know much about dragon culture." Hankree also added that they were hoping to find out the mystery behind why dragons were so in love with tacos. The guide paused for a moment when Hankree mentioned dragons loving tacos. A sad yet determined look came over his face, but just for a moment. He quickly recovered and started going on about the decore choices the designers made when building the factory.  They turned and went down a hall that had glass on one side revealing the factory floor. The guide in the black suit pointed out different machines used to make salsa as they walked. Maddy started asking questions about a portion of the floor behind a giant divider. The guide talked more about the salsa creation process and where the ingredients were sourced but never got back around to answering Maddy/Ada/Agent G's question. Noticing the oversite Hankree tried to insist that we go back to the question Maddy asked, but this time the guide told them all would be explained in the next part of the tour. It would be a presentation on TMS Inc with a Q&A. "Only the VIPs get this special presentation. Please, have a seat. " The dark-suited guide added as he directed them into a boardroom at the end of the glass hall. The dinosaurs and Maddy sat down and got comfortable. There were some glasses and bottles of sparkling water at the table, Penelope reached over and opened a bottle as the dark-suited guide walked back into the room. "It's not too often that we get VIP guests here at TMS inc. I do believe that since our inception you all are the only ones. It makes me wonder why the Mayor would clear you all for an audience." Tiny started to say something about them having connections when the dark-suited guide continued "Irregardless I know why you are here." The guide suddenly pushed a button on the wall and immediately restrains were activated, strapping the motley crew to their chairs as the Dark Dragon laughed. "I know who you are, you are not VIP you are just a random assortment of dinosaurs from out of town. That Kid invited you to his party in hopes that he could somehow stop us. He has suspected us from the start. Even you, Maddy are only here due to his meddling. We may not be able to ensnare him yet, but we do have you all. With that, the dark-suited dragon seemingly snatched off his head revealing a human man. The group still straped to their chairs let out a yelp. Then Maddy started yelling "William "T is for Takeover" Drake, real-estate mogul and all-around evil guy!"  The man in the dragon costume continued to laugh "that would be me, using spicy salsa to take over Dragonland! I am going to devalue the land and run everyone out. then I'm going to pave over the entire land and turn it into an airport with the world's largest parking lot! I'll make even more millions!"  "But Why!" Tiny shouted, "why do that to the dragons?!" Takeover Drake turned and glared at Tiny, straightened his tie, leaned in, and yelled. "Because I HATE TACOS!" Maddy promptly fainted as Takeover Drake continued "Tacos are disgusting, they are the absolute worst food because they are comprised of terrible foods. Lettuce tomatoes, ground beef or chicken, sour cream, and cheese. All are bad and horrid alone, if you threw it into a dumpster fire swept up the ashes, and ate it the taste would be the same as before you destroyed it. By pumping spicy salsa into the ground I will rid this land of tacos, killing the taco crops, because I discovered the secret. All taco crops in Dragonland, just like all the dragons, have an adverse reaction to a spicy environment. I would go as far as to say that the sole reason dragons can't stomach spicy salsa is because the ingredients used can't stomach spicy either. Somehow the dragons here and the taco crops here have evolved that way together over the decades. I supposed the reason the dragons here love tacos so much is the same. Either way, I believe by introducing enough spice into both equations will result in the property damage and taco withdrawal depression that I need for all the dragons to leave and for my corporation to come in and buy the entire land for pennies on the dollar. " Rouge yelled out "just because you hate tacos why ruin them for a whole land of people who love them!" "Because I can!" Drake replied. "I"m rich! That means my way is the right way by default. Everyone will submit to my will one way or another. And my will says that the only superior food is warm pretzels with regular yellow mustard. The pretzels must be extra warm and doughy and only regular yellow mustard is allowed. Attempting to use any other mustard, especially spicy brown mustard, will be punishable by death." Maddy had since recovered from her fainting spell and screamed out "but dragons hate extra warm doughy pretzels with regular mustard the most!" Drake turned on her and laughed "I know!" Maddy begin to wail and mutter "you evil man," while the dinosaurs remained somber.  Drake started back up "In three more years all of Dragonland will be mine. As for you in about three more minutes you will all be dead." He pressed another hidden button and a trap door below all the chairs opened up. The chairs were connected to long poles that were now descending towards a giant vat of spicy Salsa that was not only spicy but also heated. "Hot spicy Salsa!" Tiny yelled followed by Hankrees "Oh No!" "Oh yes!" Takeover Drake yelled as he started to cackle. "What are we going to do!" Maddy yelled Penelope followed with " I already ordered my dress for prom, I can't die here!" Rouge just cried. Suddenly there was a loud boom and smoke filled the room. Before anyone could figure out what was going on dragon special ops team members were repelling down into the room from a hole they blew into the ceiling. A few tied up Takeover Drake while the rest managed to figure out the wiring and reverse the dinosaurs plus Maddies descent into hot spicy salsa. </p>
