	<h1>Chapter Three: The After Party </h1>

	<p>A dragon standing next to a front room window was chatting with his friends when suddenly he burped. On most occasions, no one would have even noticed. Everyone noticed this time, as a stream of fire came out of his mouth, catching the curtains on fire when he burped. The dragons in question seemed just as shocked to see the curtains burning as everyone else. Everyone on the first floor of the house stopped and stared at the curtains, bringing the party to a sudden halt even as the music kept blasting and the lights kept flashing. Tinny snapped out of the shock that had overtaken the room first. He grabbed the punchbowl and threw its red sugary contents at the burning curtains, successfully putting the fire out. Despite his heroic efforts, no one applauded. Instead, all of the dragon's faces transformed, all changing from shocked party faces into strongly disapproving looks. Tiny, thinking everyone was mad at him, squeaked out, "Sorr..." but before he could finish, The Kid yelled "RUNNN!" and sprinted towards the kitchen. In the background, you could hear a low grumble reverberated around the room. It was the sound of a houseful of dragon stomachs grumbling in unison along with a hint of the whooshing sound made by those dragons turning to look at each other in an uncomfortable panic. The Kid was franticly digging through the kitchen recycling bin. Suddenly he arose from the bin grasping an empty salsa container. He looked closely at the label and then turned towards the dinosaurs, mouth agape, then it happened. In unison, all the dragons started to burp fire catching the whole house up in flames. As streams of fire jetted around the room, the dinosaurs began to run. Thankfully they all just barely made it out in time. As they huddled together in T.K's front yard, not too far from the boat. All they could do was stand there and watched the house burn down.

The dragons, obviously impervious to flames, didn't rush to flee the house. Once it burnt down, they were all still inside, crying. The dinosaurs collectively started to tear up over all the destruction and sadness when The Kid walked up to them. "I'm so sorry about all of this," he said. "It was shaping up to be a great party." Hankree sounding very blue, asked in a sorrowful tone, "What happen?" The Kid begins to explain. You see, it seems that in DragonLand, yes, this realm is called DragonLand. It is a very established fact that dragons love tacos.
You could think of any kind of taco, tofu, beef, chicken, even banana tacos. As long as the food medium is served in a taco vehicle, dragons will love it. Dragons also love anything that accompanies tacos, the toppings, serving trays, and especially the parties. There is only one thing that all dragons HATE when it comes to tacos, Spicy Salsa. It has been well established over decades that Spicy Salsa should never be given to a dragon, that is, unless your goal is for it to start unwillingly spewing fire. Spicy Salsa always gives dragons literal heartburn. Their stomachs can't take the spice giving them acid reflux. Due to dragon anatomy and physiology, that reflux starts out as acid. It travels through their cells as an acid, pooling into the area surrounding their heart, as their hearts are below their stomachs, and the acid pools out downward. Once the acid is around the heart, it is exposed to air, as dragons' lungs are behind their heart. Once exposed to air, acid turns into flames, as that happens when dragon acid meets air. The fire causes mass discomfort to the dragon involved, who, in response, will begin to burp uncontrollably. This burping increases the amount of air available to the acid flames, stoking the fire and expelling it from the dragon's body. As this is an entirely different process than when dragons willingly spew fire, the flames in this scenario tend to be much hotter than regular dragon flames.
After hearing this, Hankree, a scientist at heart, asked, "So is that why the house burned down so quickly?" To which The Kid responded with surprise and a smirk, "that's exactly why great observation! Hey, since you are so good at observations, maybe you all can help me solve a mystery." Upon hearing the word mystery, Rouge perked up. "Mystery? I love mysteries! I would be happy to help!" "Me too!" Tiny added. "The helping part, not the loving mysteries part. I'm great at helping but bad at puzzles." At this point, everyone turned to look at Penelope as she had not replied to The Kid's request. She looked back and then thought for a second. "So, if we help you with this mystery, that means you are going to make us all VIP guests at an epic after "the house actually burned down" party, correct? I mean, we need to get something out of this deal." The Kid laughed, "of course! In fact, I will make you guys VIPs for life to all my parties if you solve this one." </p>
