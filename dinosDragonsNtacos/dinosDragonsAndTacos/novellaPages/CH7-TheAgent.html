	<h1>Chapter Seven: The Agent </h1>

<p> None of the dinosaurs slept that night. They all stayed awake with Sheral at the checkout desk. Even Jackie, Paul, and Bart joined them.  They had a wake of sorts for the Taco Cave. Paul had been inside when the place caught fire, and everyone was asking him what had happened. While everyone was outside, word had spread that it must have been a grease fire that had set off the place. Paul let them know that he had just finished his manager rounds not five minutes before the fire, so he knew it wasn't anything like that. He said that he saw a sus looking dragon talking on a cell phone behind the restaurant by the trash cans when he took the trash out. It was someone Paul had never seen in town or at the Taco Cave before. When he checked the cameras in the middle of his rounds, Paul had seen that same dragon walking towards the trash cans from the back door. At that point, Bart had called him over to see if he could fix the soda machine. They had it jerry-rigged, and when it broke, Paul had the magic touch. It took less than 5 minutes to fix the machine, after which Paul went back to look at the cameras. Before he made it back to the screens, the place was on fire. Paul, convinced the sus dragon did it, couldn't figure out why anyone would want the Taco Cave to burn down. All dragons loved Tacos; it was in their DNA.</p>

<p> Hankree took copious notes while Paul was talking. Once Paul finished his story, Hankree added: "find out more about Secret Agent Sus and his connection to the fire" on his to-do list.  The dragons kept the dinosaurs up late, telling tale after tale of Taco Cave adventures.  Finally, Paul and his crew headed towards town, and the dinosaurs, including Hankree this time, headed for bed. The next day the dinosaurs headed to the front desk to say good morning to Sherral, but they were met with an uproar. Guest were crowded around the front desk and yelling at Sherral. They were all angry that the breakfast taco bar had been shut down indefinitely. Most had woken up extra early to ensure that they got at least one Taco. The issue was that since the bar ran out every single day, the hotel stopped trying to keep taco supplies on hand. They instead opted to have a running order with the Taco Cave to bring over supplies after the restaurant closed in the few hours between the slow night shift and the morning rush. Since the Taco Cave burned down the previous afternoon, there was no delivery. Subsequently, since all the guests who planned to get a taco for breakfast tend to go to bed unreasonably early to ensure they don't miss the breakfast taco, none knew about the Taco Cave tragedy.</p>

<p>Now they were all very emotional about their loss and yelling at Sherral. Hankree, upon seeing this harsh treatment of his precious Sherral, lost it. He ran over and began arguing with the guest, arguing with Sherral. Tiny jumped in to try and smooth things over, but it was too late, and he got caught up in a shouting match with a guest who was yelling at Hankree. Having a lot of experience with mean girls at school, Penelope rushed in with her insult cannons blazing.  Rouge stood back and watched; she was not equipped to handle that much conflict. That's when she felt a hand on her shoulder. Rouge turned to face a dragon, he was short, and something about his overall demeanor seemed off. He had on shades, a black bowler hat, a tourist t-shirt, and some beach shorts with flip flops. He smiled and then suddenly pulled Rouge close to him. He leaned in and whispered come to the institute and shoved something into her hand. There was a shout and a clatter near the check-in desk at that moment. Rouge turned to see that one of the angry guests had nocked over the pen holder while banging on the desk. Tiny jumped into action, trying to gather all the pens, and Sherell started to cry. Her tears calmed all the angry guests down. They all started apologizing in unison, suddenly feeling foolish for their behavior. Rouge turned back to the mysterious dragon to comment on the effects of sleep deprivation, but he was gone. She looked down at the paper in her hand. It had been torn from letterhead for someplace called the Taco Institue, and the name Maddy was scribbled on it. She walked over to Sherealls desk to help console her and forgot all about the note and the mysterious stranger. Later in the evening, she retold the story to the group. Sheral told them that the Taco Institue was downtown. They were leading all the cutting-edge technologies about everything tacos and taco related. Apparently, they also gave tours during the week. Hankree spearheaded the planning of the visit they would make in the morning to see it. </p>
