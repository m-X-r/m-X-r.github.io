	<h1>Chapter Twelve: Afterward </h1>

<p>
Afterward:
<br><br>
Tiny 
<br>
changed his major to soil studies and applied to Dragon Science academy. He lived in Ms. Kim's spare room while he went to school and then purchased a house not too far away once he got his first job. They have Sunday dinner every week.
<br><br>
Rouge
<br>
Rouge moved to Dragonland and stayed in the secret flat that Agent G, Ada Twist, and Maddy shared. Rouge and Agent G became like Maddie's parents and Ada Twist was like the sister that traveled a lot for work but was always happy to be home. Rouge became a poet laureate, writing book after book of beautiful reflective love poems based on the love in her life new and old. Two of her best-selling poems were about her love for Mary and her love of tacos and guac with a side of totally mild salsa.
<br><br>
Penelope
<br>
Invited Paul to prom with her at the end of the night he proposed to her. She said yes and they got married. She now runs a chain of fashion boutiques in between Dragonland and Dinotown and she's looking to expand to Humanworld. Ada does not think humans are quite prepared to interact with Dragons or Dinosaurs so she is working on building a human robot that Penelope can use to run her human fashion boutique empire. 
<br><br>
Hankree
<br>
Managed to get a transfer to be a Trash Collector for Dragonland. He also picked up a part-time job as the fix-it man for the Hotel and the unofficial fix-it man around town. He sold his house and all the stuff in it and got a permanent room in the hotel. He was also gifted a lab space at the TacoInstitute so he still has a chance to tinker.  Hankree and Sherral continue to spend their nights talking together in the lobby at the Hotel.
<br><br>
William "T is for Takeover" Drake
<br>
Drake went to prison. It took a few days for his lawyer to try and get all the charges dropped by paying off various judges and officials. In that time a prison riot broke and Drake was stabbed by a homemade jolly rancher shank. His injuries were minimal, but the maker of that shank was later found to have rabies. Drake's rabies was not caught in time and he went quite mad. Drake is currently locked up in a federal mental asylum for the criminally insane. </p>
