	<h1>Chapter Eight: Taco Institute </h1>

<p>The following morning the dinosaurs headed out early; Hankree wanted to get to the Institue right when it opened and get the first tour when the guide would be fresh and full of energy; he even convinced Sherell to come with them. Penelope secretly hoped that while they were there, they might also find out why dragons love tacos so much. When they first walked inside the Insitute, they didn't see anyone. No one was at the entry desk, there was no tourist, students, or scientist, but the door had been unlocked. They decided to start walking around to see what they could see. As they made their way down an empty hallway, they saw a young dragon walking out of a bathroom in a lab coat. Rouge waved the dragon down. "Hi, we are visiting from out of town. You wouldn't happen to know Maddy would you?"</p>

<p>The dragon's disposition became very bright and cheery. "Of course I do! I'm Maddy!" She smiled and let out a small giggle. Rouge and Maddy seemed to become instant pals. They found out that Maddy was a taco shell scientist. She's also a new hire, which is why she was in charge of opening and operating the entry desk this morning. She had just stepped away to go to the restroom. Usually, they don't have that many visitors. Maddy told the dinosaurs and Sherall that tours only happen on Fridays. But she was sure no one would come, mainly because no one ever did unless they were hosting a special event. So she would give them a special scientist tour. She added that she had never given or gone on an official tour in her whole life, so though she did not know what "official" tours entailed, she would do her best.</p>

<p>As Maddy showed them inside some of the empty labs inside the institute. She told them how she liked the empty labs the best. They let her imagine what her future would look like at the institute. They started to walk into a conference room when they stopped short. It was full of scientists staring at a giant whiteboard and mumbling. After they backed out Hankree pulled Maddy off to the side "What's going on?" he asked. "It's classified," she said back a little too loud. then she started walking off down the hall, just past the open conference room doors. Then she looked around to see if anyone else was watching and signaled to the dinosaurs to rush into a door she opened. The door she opened was a mop closet door but all the dinos managed to squeeze in just enough so she could close the door.  Maddy clicked on the single overhead lightbulb and started to whisper. "Ok, if I tell you guys this, you have to swear to not tell any dragon ever." "Deal!" they all whispered back in unison. Maddy started up again "Seriously! If you tell any dragon and word gets out, I will lose my job! You guys know how much I love my job!" Rouge took Maddy's hand, leaned in, and whispered "You can trust us. We would never do anything to get you in trouble I'll make sure of it." She squeezed Maddie's hand and gave her a sweet smile. Then Maddy started to tell them the story.</p>

<p>About two and a half years ago, the dragon scientist noticed a slight reduction in taco crops. No one knew why but they did know that the yield had slightly declined by about 0.36%. No one paid much attention at the time as slight fluctuations are normal but six months after the decline it didn't get any better. Even though each time it was only by a fraction of a percent the decline remained. Over the past year and a half, the decline started becoming a bigger concern. The scientist still had no clue as to the cause or the solution and now the shortages were becoming more and more apparent to the dragon community at large. It had gotten to the point where the dragons had to cave and bring in a renowned human scientist whose name was Ada Twist. Besides The Kid, no other humans had ever been to Dragonland. At this point, all the scientists were willing to try anything to figure out what was happening. Ada was an expert at investigative researching techniques, but at the moment even she was having issues. If they didn't find the source soon, the backup taco supply would be depleted, and there would be no tacos left in Dragonland. If they could not find the problem they might never have tacos in Dragonland again.</p>

<p>at this point, Maddy became somber and quiet and started looking down at her feet, obviously shaken up at the prospect of no tacos in Dragonland. Penelope started to speak "Why do Dragons love ta..." Suddenly Tiny cut her off with an aggressive whisper "Shhhhhhhh! You have to whisper." Then he turned towards Maddy and asked in a whisper "Do you think it has something to do with TMS inc?" Rouge chimed in "We all think they are up to something." Maddy looked up suddenly, a questioning look in her eyes. "TMS inc?" She whispered when the door suddenly swung open. A skinny, short girl was standing in the doorway backlit by the light from the hallway. She had cocoa brown skin and two big black afro puffs on each side of her head with two beautiful ribbons holding them in place. "What's going on here, Scientist Maddy? Why are there dinosaurs here? More importantly, how did you all fit in this closet?" Hankree began to reply "barely" when all the dinosaurs plus Maddy fell out of the closet as if on cue. They all clamored to their feet to see the young girl still staring at them. Maddy begins to stutter. "Scientist Twist! I...." Ada Twist Scientist cut her off after glancing down the hall. The group of scientists in the conference room was staring at them from down the hall, attracted by the noise. "All of you, in my office, now." Ada directed the group into a large corner laboratory at the end of the hall. Once they were inside the lab with the door closed Ada asked again. "Scientist Maddy, who are these dinosaurs, and what do they know about TMS inc?" Maddy quickly went from startled to scientist mode, yelling out "What is TMS inc!" Everyone in the room shussed Maddy.  Ada looked at the group and gave a deep sigh. Then she walked to the far wall of her laboratory and knocked three times on the wall. The wall opened to reveal a secret room. "Come with me," Ada commanded and walked into the room. The dinosaurs and Maddy gave each other a look and they followed. </p>
