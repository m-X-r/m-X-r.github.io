	<h1>Chapter Four: Dinosaurs on the Case !</h1>

	<p>"So, Kid, or do you prefer The Kid? Either way, what's the caper? I'm so excited!" Rouge was practically vibrating with excitement. "Either is fine by me, The Kid replied. I'm glad you are so amped! Here is the deal." The Kid goes on to tell the dinosaurs how He is known to throw taco parties. He has thrown so many that he has developed quite the talent for taco party planning. The Kid has a seemingly never-ending waitlist full of party participants. The list is a new development for The Kid. He had to do something after a whistleblower leaked news of an underground dragon fight club to the local newspaper. It seems the dragons created the fight club years ago in an effort to decide who would get the chance to attend The Kid's next party. They managed to keep it a secret for years, but one dejected participant, tired of constantly losing fights and never being able to attend a party, spilled the beans. </p>

<p>"A fight club! that's hardcore!" Tiny interjects, to which Penelope replies, "Duh, dragons, of course, they would have a fight club." The Kid tries to finish explaining the nature of the caper, but then Hankree interrupts. "Penelope, dear, I have to say that statement you just made is very racist towards dragons. You are just facilitating a stereotype. I mean, how many dragons have you ever spent time around? This party was the first time I have ever interacted with a dragon, and from what I saw, they seem to be rather pleasant." Suddenly Rouge begins to shout, "Let him finish the story! I need this mystery!" All the dinosaurs, The Kid, and a few weeping dragons stop what they are doing to stare at her. "Sorry," she says quietly. "I'm just so excited." The Kid smiles and nods at Rouge, "Thanks, that was awkward." </p>

<p>As The Kid continues, the dinosaurs learn that since he lives in DragonLand, and throws many taco parties, The Kid is very aware of dragons' spicy salsa intolerance. So he has made it a habit to check his salsa jars multiple times to be extra sure that his salsas are always mild. Sometimes, when he wants to be fancy, The Kid will import unique salsas, like Super Extra Mild Salsa or Bland Times Ten Salsa. He even orders his Salsa from the same taco supply superstore, even though they recently built a new one closer to his house. The Kid becomes distraught, "I'm just so confused as to how this taco tragedy could have even happened." Luckily, The Kid rescued a lone empty salsa jar from his house before it burned down. He held it up for all to see, "Look! the label even says Totally Mild Salsa!" Everyone, including the few dragons who were weeping before they were distracted by Rouge's outburst and were now invested in this conversation, Gasped. "Look! It says Totaly Mild Salsa in Big, Bold, Letters!"
Penelope yelled, spinning around and pointing at the jar. Suddenly Hankree reached out for the jar "let me see that!" The Kid handed the jar over to Hankree so that he could examine it. Hankree looked at the jar closely. Then he franticly started rummaging through his bag. "Got it!" he said, pulling out a huge and antique-looking magnifying glass. "How old is that thing?" Tiny inquired. Hankree was too busy studying the label on the glass to answer. Tiny was responded to, in a sense, by Rouge and Penelope. They ended up starting a conversation debating the merits of actual antique items vs. remodeling items to have an antique look to them. Just as Rouge began talking about her favorites among various wood stains you can use to make chairs look older, Hankree shouted. "Eurika! Look at this under the substantial, bold, and colorful Totaly Mild Salsa text. Also, in colors, only about three fractions of a shade different from the original label color. While also being slightly covered by the border art of the label, you will see this." The dinosaurs, The Kid, and those few formerly weepy dragons gathered around Hankree and the magnifying glass. Hankree had the magnifying glass held out far enough from the jar so everyone could read the very concealed in plain sight words:</p>

<h2>TOTALY MILD SALSA!  NOW WITH SPICY JALAPENO PEPPERS! </h2>

<p>"Spicy Jalapeno Peppers!" The Kid shouted with abandon, "those are nowhere near being Totally Mild! No wonder my house got burned down." The Kid paused to think, and then he said, "I'm surprised the fire didn't happen sooner. We were partying for at least an hour before you dinosaurs showed up." The Kid just shook his head slowly and looked down at the ground. "Who would do such a thing! DragonLand is the largest importer of Salsa.  Every single Salsa Manufacture in the world knows that dragons hate spicy Salsa. The High-End Mild Salsa industry started because of us!" At this point, the Kid got visibly upset and had to excuse himself. Only, as his house had just burned down, he had no place to go. So he just stood behind the boat that was once filled with tacos and wept. "Guys, we have got to solve this mystery. Look at him. We can't leave him like this." "You are exactly right!" Rouge said with a fierce and determined look in her eyes. "I know just where to start." After that, Rouge spun dramatically, getting all up in one of the dragons who had recently become involved in the conversations faces. "Hey, do you all have city directories in DragonLand?" After Rouge and Hankree, being the oldest people at the party, thoroughly explained what city directories were, followed by all the younger people explaining what Google was to them, a search was performed. Using the rescued salsa jar and Hankree's magnifying glass, they found the company's name that made Totally Mild Salsa.  On the label, in even smaller letters and a lighter font than the spicy jalapenos statement, they saw that TotalyMildSalsa inc made the Salsa. After their Google search, they saw that the manufacture and the main headquarters for TotalyMildSalsa inc were actually in DragonLand, at 466 NotSusAtAll Lane.</p>


<p>"Egads!" Tiny shouted, pointing his index finger straight up in the air. He was trying out his best Sherlock Holmes impression, but it didn't go over well. "Now, how do we get there. Dragons, what're your two cents?" Rouge, along with the rest of the dinosaurs, turned to stare at the dragons. The dragons, in turn, just shrugged and slowly backed away. The dinosaurs looked around to see who else might give them directions. They couldn't ask The Kid because he was still crying behind the empty taco boat, and all the other weeping dragons had scattered. "Now what?" Penelope asked. "We need a map." Hankree replied, "now, where we can obtain one is a different story." The dinosaurs looked around, hoping to glean some new information out of their situation. "What about that?" Tiny said, pointing off in the distance. There was an illuminated sign a little ways off. The dinosaurs could not read what the sign said from their current location, but they knew that those kinds of signs were usually found at restaurants and gas stations. So Hankree figured that the 50% chance they had of finding a gas station where they could buy a map was good enough for them to walk to see what was at that sign.</p>
