	<h1>Chapter One: Introductions </h1>

	<p>Tiny the T-rex, in name and stature, just turned 19 a week ago. His birthday lands at the beginning of summer. This summer, his first summer after graduating high school, he spent his birthday at home with his parents, not doing much. His mom made his favorite dinner, and his dad picked up a cake from the local bakery. His older brother and sister, who had moved away years ago, called from out of state and sang him a happy birthday song. All Tiny's friends from school were out of town for the summer. That didn't matter so much because most of them were also going to school out of state, so graduation was pretty much the last time he would see them. Tiny wanted to do something special to commemorate this new segment of life, leaving high school and transitioning to something new and a little scary. Everyone did the best they could to make his day as unique as possible, but it was nothing like what he envisioned. After his birthday, Tiny felt uninspired. He spent most of his time replaying video games and taking lazy walks through the neighborhood. At the end of a lazy stroll, midsummer, Tinny saw the mailman driving off as he got home. He waved and then went to check the mail. There was a sales paper for the local grocery store and something else, a fancy-looking envelope shaped like a taco. The envelope, with its wax seal engraved with the letters T.K., was addressed to him. Who could have possibly sent him this awesome invitation?</p>

<p>Rouge, the raptor, grew up under the tutelage of a human. She was raised as a pet, kind of like a cat, and loved her life and her human.  Her human, Mary, was 28 when she adopted Rouge. They spent 30 beautiful years together until the day Mary passed away in her sleep. Rouge was moved out of the home she grew up in and into a group home for abandoned dinosaurs. Rouge was despondent all the time her first couple of years in the group home. She would stay in her room and keep to herself for the most part. She didn't grow up around dinosaurs, only Mary, so she wasn't sure how to interact with the others. One day a new resident came to live in the home, a stegosaurus named Bruce. He was about Rouge's age and was determined to get to know everyone, including her. He made sure to stop by and speak to her every day; he even started dragging her to the social evenings they had once a month. After a while, Rouge came out of her shell and began making friends. Bruce left to live with an extended family member, but he wrote everyone letters every now and again.  One day she was sitting in her room flipping thru a photo album. Mary had made it after some adventure they had. They used to have a lot of adventures together. Mary had just turned to the last page when she heard a knock at the door. She looked up to see Max, the orderly, and He told her that she had gotten some mail while handing her an envelope. 
It was fancy, shaped like a taco with a wax seal engraved with the letters T.K. closing it. It all looked a little too elaborate for Bruce to have sent it. She wondered who did send it while sitting on her bed, admiring the envelope.</p>

<p>Penelope was a teenage Trex. She was 16 and living her best life. She went to an all-human school, but nobody treated her any different. Well, now nobody treated her differently. When she was in the first grade and first introduced to human children, she had some issues making friends. Mostly because she found humans to be delicious, and she kept trying to eat all her classmates. She learned the hard way that eating your classmates makes them feel bad the day that the goldfish attempted to eat her. She dropped her human cravings cold turkey from then on, and since she has become quite popular. Now, she has plenty of friends and is even a cheerleader and the top gymnast in her school. She has fashioned herself into somewhat of an "it" girl. One afternoon while home sitting on the couch searching thru magazines for the perfect dress when the phone rang. She rushed to answer, because why wouldn't it be for her. When she answered, she heard her best friend Katie's voice. Katie had called to tell her about a party Tom Kanes was throwing. Tom was a sophomore. He came from a wealthy family and always threw rowdy parties because his parents were always gone. It was his way to rebel to get back at his parents for his loneliness. All the cool kids went to Tom's parties, so she was a little miffed at hearing he was having another one, and she had yet to be officially invited. Before she could get mad, Katie told her that Tom had sent out a bunch of invitations in the mail. The theme of the party was retro. Katie had heard that there would be cassette tape decks and aerobics videos playing at the party. As soon as Penelope got off the phone, she rushed outside to check the mailbox, as she knew that there was absolutely no way she didn't get an invite to this party. Inside she saw a fancy envelope shaped like a taco. It had a wax seal closing it with the letters T.K. engraved into the wax. Cute, she thought as she took the envelope back upstairs. She meant to call Katie back but got caught up looking at dresses in her magazines.</p>

<p>Hankree was a middle-aged Trex who had just finished celebrating his 40th birthday. He worked as a trash collector in his town and loved his job. He looked forward to going to work every day. Hankree came from a line of trash collectors. His dad, granddad, and even his grandma on his mom's side had collected trash in that very same town. As a hobby, Hankree enjoyed tinkering. His job allowed him to collect all sorts of material. Whenever he saw something interesting that someone had thrown out, he would take it home and make it better. He had been doing it since he was a child. His dad would bring him all sorts of stuff to tinker with, and he would make all kinds of things. In the past, he had made a soft-serve ice coffee machine that was a big hit. He had also created a pair of headphones that was supposed to play the song that you were thinking of but couldn't quite remember. Instead, it only played Livin La Viva Loca on repeat. That one was not such a big hit. Hankree was a happy and creative dino, and everyone loved him most of the time. The thing about Hankree was that he tended to get caught up in his work, so caught up that he would forget to do basic things. Stuff like picking up his dry cleaning, brushing his teeth, even eating and sleeping. Most of those things were fine but forgetting to eat became a significant issue for Hankree. When he failed to eat, he became hangry. That means bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger. When hangry, Hankree tended to go on rampages, looking for food and destroying property. Sometimes someone would get him a sandwich before he got too far away from his house. But on occasion, Hankree would make it out of the neighborhood. When he did, he always made a beeline to a human community.  Hankree thought humans were a delicious and rare delicacy, craving them the most notably when hangry. That is until he met a human boy named Hal. Hal refused to be eaten by Hankree and trapped him until he didn't desire to eat humans anymore.  After, Hal and Hankree became good friends. The same day Hal trapped Hankree was also the same day Hals mom made Hankree dinner. Spaghetti with meatballs and garlic bread. After that, every time Hankree got hangry, he would run straight to Hal's house and wait for dinner. He even learned to cook to make dinner for Hal and his family from time to time. One day as Hankree was getting home from work, he saw Hal waiting for him on his porch.
Hal's mom had made way too much spaghetti, so Hal brought some for Hankree and all his coworkers. Everyone in Hankrees neighborhood loved Hal's mom's cooking.  Hal told Hankree that while he was waiting for him to come home, the postman had dropped off a letter for him. Hal handed Hankree a fancy-looking envelope shaped like a taco. It had a wax seal engraved with the letters T.K. closing it. "It looks like you have been invited to a taco party," Hal said while handing it over. "Be sure to bring back some taco recipes that we can try out," Hal added as they walked inside. Hankree didn't know who T.K. was, but he did love trying new things.</p>
