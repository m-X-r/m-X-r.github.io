<h1>Head and Body Containers</h1>

<p>Now our main document is going to consist of two big containers. Our head container and our body container. Our head container is going to mostly communicate style and our body container is going to mostly communicate substance. To add these two style and substance containers make a space below your html starting tag and indent some. Then type the following:</p>

<h2>
&lt!Doctype html&gt 
<br>
&lthtml&gt
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lthead&gt <!--HEAD-->
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/head&gt<!--/HEAD-->
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltbody&gt<!--BODY-->
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/body&gt<!--/BODY-->
<br>
<br>
&lt/html&gt
</h2>
<p>Dont forget the most important step. Save!</p>

<p>Now let's style up our page just a little bit. Using another container, we are going to add a title that is going to add text to the tab that the browser will show above the web page. We are going to use a title tag to accomplish this. Go back to your notepad document. In the space below your starting head tag indent some and then type the following:</p>

<h2>
&lt!Doctype html&gt 
<br>
&lthtml&gt
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lthead&gt <!--HEAD-->
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lttitle&gt Mom Pigs House &lt/title&gt
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/head&gt<!--/HEAD-->
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &ltbody&gt<!--BODY-->
<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/body&gt<!--/BODY-->
<br>
<br>
&lt/html&gt
</h2>

<p>Don’t forget!....... I’m sure you have the Most Important Step memorized by now so I will stop repeating it. Once that most important step is done, double click on your file. It should open in your browser and you should see something like this:</p>

<img src="pictures/momPigsHouseTitleTab.JPG" alt="Mom Pigs House Title Tab" >

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="revampFifteen.html" >Ready for the Next Step?</a></p>

</body>
</html>
