<h1> Third Pigs House </h1>

<p>
The man pleaded with the pig, "oh come on! Trust me! You will love the fair! If you miss it you will regret it, that is a fact and a promise."</p>
<p>"I don't want to get eaten," the pig replied "I have so much more to do in life, including finding my fortune."</p>
<p>"We will be together, so either we both get eaten or we both do not get eaten. How about that?" The farmer tried to reason with the pig.</p>
<p>I guess it would be better getting eaten if I wasn't alone. Alright! I'll go!"</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="fairYes.html">"You are going to love the fair!" The man shouted. Then him and the pig gave each other a high-five. </a></li>
</ul>
