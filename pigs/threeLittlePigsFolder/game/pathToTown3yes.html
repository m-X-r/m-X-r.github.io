<h1> Path to Town </h1>

<p>"Ok brother, stay safe!" yelled out the second pig, as he and his brother left the first pig to rest.</p>
<p>The first pig had a sound sleep that night. In the morning he was just about to make breakfast when he heard a knock at the door. "Who is it!" He shouted. "This is private property!"</p>
<p>In reply he heard a deep husky voice. "Private property my eye, this looks like the grocery store and I've come to get my breakfast, now let me in!"</p>
<p>The first pig looked out the window and saw a great wolf. "It's a wolf come to eat me he whispered to no one in particular, what should I do? Oh, I think so much better when my brothers are around."</p>
<p>While the first pig was trying to come up with a plan the wolf outside took a big breath and blew the straw house down.</p>
<p>"Oh My!" were the last words the first pig got out before the wolf ate him.</p>
<p>"Breakfast of champions!" The wolf shouted aloud to no one in particular.</p>
