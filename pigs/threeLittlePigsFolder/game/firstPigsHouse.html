<h1> First Pigs House </h1>

<p>
The second and third pig brothers watched as the first built his house. After he was done, they complemented him on his work. "We are going to keep heading to town." The second pig said to the first. "Do you want to come with us?" "No, no," the first pig said. "I am very tired after building that house. I think I will stay and rest." "We can wait on you, spend the night in your new house and start fresh in the morning." The third pig suggested.

<ul>
    <li> <a href="pathToTown3yes.html">"No, no I don't want to keep you from your fortunes. Go on without me." The first pig said.</a></li>

    <li> <a href="pathToTown3no.html">"That sounds like a great idea brother. Let's spend the night here. I have enough straw left to make us all a bed." The first pig said.</a></li>
