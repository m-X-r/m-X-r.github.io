<h1> You Win! </h1>

<p>
The wolf mumbled to himself as he walked over to the brick pile. He grabbed the ladder and climbed up on the roof. He saw the chimney and walked over to it. The smoke coming out burned his eyes. "This is a great illusion!" He yelled "But here I come pig! Get ready to be breakfast!" The wolf jumped in and landed in the boiling pot of water.</p>

<p>The man dashed over to the pot with a knife and went to work. The pig was watching all this happen. He saw the wolf fall into the pot, he saw the man rush over, he saw quick movements, he heard a quick yell, and then he saw his brothers. "What!" The third pig started to say, but his brothers cut him off.</p>

<p>"Brother!" They yelled in unison as they ran towards him and hugged him. In that moment the third pig had no clue what the man did, or how his brothers were alive after being eaten by a wolf days before. But what he did know was that he didn't care, he was just happy to be surrounded by people he loved.</p>

<p>The third pig made room in his house for his brothers. He tried to get them to go into the brick business with him, but they were not interested in bricks. The first brother still liked straw, he now preferred to build fires with it over building houses with it. He stoked the best fires for the third brothers brick baking stove, He also made great fires for BBQs. He became known as the best grill master around.</p>

<p>The second brother still loved furze, and he still loved birdhouses. He built the most elaborate bird houses that anyone had ever seen. He sold them in town for a while, but once word got out, he had a waitlist so long he moved into custom work only. He worked from his brother's house and only went to town to drop them off to buyers. The town made a day of it whenever he came to town. There was live music, food trucks, and a show. The day ended with the second pig presenting the birdhouse to the customer on stage so everyone in town could get a chance to see the newest birdhouse.</p>

<p>The third pig became a brick artisan. He not only made bricks but he made the most beautiful things out of bricks. He built his mom a new house and made her the most beautiful well out of brick. He put up the best brick fence around the rolling hills drop off. It was so fantastic that his mom regularly got visitors just to see the fence and gaze out at the view. She built a little garden around the well and that became peoples second stop after the drop off. From then on whenever anyone wanted a brick anything built, they sought him out.</p>

<p>In the end all the pigs had in fact found their fortunes. So of course, they lived happily ever after.</p>
