<h1> Third Pigs House </h1>

<p>The next day as they were eating breakfast, the man told the pig everything that happen at the hill. The pig said that rolling down that hill was one of the best parts of the fair for him. He was about to suggest that they do it again that afternoon when they heard a tumultuous knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Hey, hey, hey! It's me, the wolf from yesterday! I was on my way to the fair when I almost died! You gotta let me in! I need to sit and talk with someone about it, preferably over tea." The wolf said.</p>

<p>"I don't think I do." The pig replied, "seeing as it was me who almost killed you."</p>

<p>"You what! How dare you!" Screamed the wolf.</p>

<p>"How dare me!" Replied the pig, "you have been trying to eat me for days, but i'm wrong!"</p>

<p>"Yes!" Screamed the wolf, "I had been having a lovely pork breakfast every day for two days in a row before I met you! I haven't gotten to eat that well for three days now! How dare you not let me eat you!"</p>

<p>The pig went cold all over, "my brothers!" he whispered, as he fell to his knees, and started crying.</p>

<p>The man, quietly listening went into action. He started a large fire in the fireplace and put a large pot of water on. "We just might have enough time," He mumbled to himself.</p>

<p>He put some herbs and a strange powder into the pot and stirred it up. He then muffled his voice and yelled out to the wolf. "Ha-ha, wolf, you will never eat me. This house is un-blow down-able! Its only weakness is the large hole in the roof. It looks like a chimney with smoke coming out, which typically means there is a fire going. But in this case, it's just a trick of the light. There is no way you would ever be smart enough to use the ladder out by the brick pile and climb up on the roof and jump in that hole!"</p>

<p>Hearing this the pig started to snap out of it. "What are...!" the man stopped him. </p>
<p>"Shusssssh! Trust me!" The man whispered to the pig. Meanwhile the wolf outside started yelling again. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="chimmneyYes.html">"Not smart enough hu!" Yelled the wolf. </a></li>
    <li> <a href="chimmneyNo.html">"I dont have to take this! I'm going home!" The wolf yelled. </a></li>
</ul>
