<h1> Path to Town </h1>

<p>"Finally, I am going to get to see the town." Said the pig.</p>
<p>"You have never been to town, said the man. Like in your whole life?"</p>
<p>"Not once, is it nice?" The pig asked.</p>
<p>The man looked at the pig with a twinkle in his eye. "Town is town the man said, what is going to be nice is the fair."</p>
<p>"I can't wait! Let's get going!" shouted the pig.</p>
