<h1> The Turnip Field </h1>

<p>
The next day at five pm sharp, the third pig was in the turnip field waiting for the fox to show up. The wolf wasn't there. The third pig waited 15 minutes, then 20, then 30! After 45 minutes the pig gathered his turnips and went home. When he got back the man was so happy to see him.</p>
<p>"You didn't get eaten!" The man exclaimed.</p>
<p>"No, I didn't get eaten. I got stood up, the wolf never showed. Wait! You thought he was going to eat me! But we agreed!" The third pig stammered.</p>
<p>"Never trust a wolf," the man said, "typically they are only trying to eat you. Everyone knows that!"</p>
<p>"Well, everyone else knew that, and now I know too." The pig said.</p>
<p>The man and the pig gave each other a high five and then they made the most delicious turnip stew.
