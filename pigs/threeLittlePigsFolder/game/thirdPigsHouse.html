<h1> Third Pigs House </h1>

<p>
The third pig and the man worked hard all afternoon building their house. They worked into the night building the brick studio off the side of the house. After all the work was done the man asked the third pig, "so after all this are you still heading towards town?"</p>
<p>The pig thought for a second. "Naw, I'm terribly tired, I'll get up early and go tomorrow."</p>
<p>"I'll go with you." The Man said.</p>
<p>"Great!" The third pig said.</p>
<p>The pig and the Man settled in for the night after that. They both got a restful sleep. In the morning the third pig was just about to make breakfast for the man and himself, when he heard a knock at the door. "Who is it!" He shouted. "This is private property!"</p>
<p>In reply he heard a deep husky voice. "Private property my eye, this looks like the grocery store and I've come to get my breakfast, now let me in!" The Man looked out the window and saw a great wolf.</p>
<p>"It's a wolf come to eat us he whispered to the third pig, what should we do? </p>
<p>"I vote, not open the door, what is he going to do, blow our house down?" Said the third pig.</p>
<p>At that both he and the man started laughing, rolling on the floor laughing out loud. The wolf heard them laughing inside and got angry.</p>
<p>"You asked for it!" he shouted, then he huffed and puffed and blew, but nothing happen. He tried again and again to no avail.</p>
<p>Realizing that he wasn't going to get a breakfast of champions this morning, the wolf decided maybe he could get a dinner of champions the next day.</p>
<p>"Hey pig," he cried, "I feel we have gotten off on the wrong foot. I'm terribly sorry about trying to eat you just now." The wolf lied, "how about as a peace treaty we make dinner together tomorrow night? There is a turnip field not too far from the lake here. We can meet there tomorrow around 5 and pick some turnips, then we can come back here and prepare a soup together. What do you say?"</p>
<p>"Sure, maybe." The third pig said. "See you tomorrow maybe."</p>
<p>With that the wolf walked away with a tremendous smirk. The man looked at the pig. </p>
<p>"Are you seriously going to meet up with that wolf tomorrow night?" He asked with concern in his eyes.</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="turnipFieldYes.html">"Sure, why not?" The third pig said. </a></li>
    <li> <a href="turnipFieldNo.html">"Absolutely not!" Said the third pig. </a></li>
