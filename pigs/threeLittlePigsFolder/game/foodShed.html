<h1> Food Shed </h1>

<p>
The pigs walk over to the Food Shed.</p>
<p>"This isn't the way to our fortune!" Shouted the third pig.</p>
<p>"Well," said the second, "I could use a snack."</p>
<p>The first pig chimed in "I could go for a tasty morsel."</p>
<p>So, the pigs had a snack and collect a little food for the road. Which Way do they go next?</p>
