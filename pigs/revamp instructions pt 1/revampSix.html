<h1>Fourth Key Point</h1>

<h2>"The Third Pig met a man with bricks and asked to build a house out of them. The third Pig then built a house. After the house was built a wolf came and asked to come in, threatened The Third Pig said no and the wolf attempted to blow down the house. The wolf tried and tried but could not blow down The Third Pigs house."</h2>

<p>This is going to go just like the First and Second Pigs Houses. We are going to make a Man with Bricks Box, as well as an additional box of Path to Town, ending with a Third Pigs House box.</p>

<p>Now we are going to block off all the paths we do not want people to take. Add in your Cannot Pass boxes where they need to go.</p>

<p>Again, the blowing down house attempt will come in the code but we are sticking to the map for now.</p>

<p> We Have now finished our Fourth Key Point of the map!</p>
