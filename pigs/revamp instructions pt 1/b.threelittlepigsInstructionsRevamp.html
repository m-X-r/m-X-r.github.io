<h1>How to make a Text based RPG game, with HTML.</h1>
<p>
We are going to be using HTML to create a text-based RPG or roleplaying game. An RPG game, according to Wikipedia, is "a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting, or through a process of structured decision-making regarding character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines."  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game" target="_blank">~Wikipedia</a>
</p>

<p>Our game will be based off a children's book, The Three Little Pigs by Josh Verbae. Using the key points of his story we will create our rules and guidelines and structure for what we want to happen.</p>

<p>So if you are ready lets go!</p>
