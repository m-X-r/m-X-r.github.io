The first thing you have to do is read the book. Now you can go out and find a hard copy of this book, but I have a better way.
</p>

<p>Go to the <a href="https://www.richlandlibrary.com/" target="_blank">library website</a> and scroll down until you see Stream & Download. Under Stream & Download you should see hoopla. click on hoopla and create or log into your account. Next you can search for The Three Little Pigs by Josh Verbae, check it out, and start reading.</p>
