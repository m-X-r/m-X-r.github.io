<h1>Body Container Tags</h1>

<p>Now we are gearing up to add a little substance to our body container. But before we do, we need to go over some basic container types to  use inside our body container. Below I will show you some basic tags and the code you need to make them happen.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li> <h1>H:</h1> the h or heading tag creates a heading or banner. So, you have text with a space above and below. Headings go from 1-6, one being the largest and six being the smallest. It goes h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6.
<h1 style="text-align:left">&lth1&gt H1 &lt/h1&gt</h1>
<h2>&lth2&gt H2 &lt/h2&gt</h2>
<h3>&lth3&gt H3 &lt/h3&gt</h3>
<h4>&lth4&gt H4 &lt/h4&gt</h4>
<h5>&lth5&gt H5 &lt/h5&gt</h5>
<h6>&lth6&gt H6 &lt/h6&gt</h6>
</li>

<li><h1>p:</h1> the paragraph container, it creates, well, a paragraph. It will block out whatever text you put in with a space above and below. Just like when using the word typing program.
<blockquote><p>&ltp&gt This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. &lt/p&gt</p>
<p>&ltp&gt This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is a paragraph.&lt/p&gt </p></blockquote></li>

<li><h1>ul or ol:</h1> These are unordered list and ordered list containers. They both do the exact same thing with one little difference. They create a bullet list, ul aka unordered list use round bullet points. Or they create numbered list, ol, aka ordered list use numbers.
<p>&ltul&gt</p>
<ul>
<li>&ltli&gt this &lt/li&gt</li>
<li>&ltli&gt is &lt/li&gt</li>
<li>&ltli&gt an &lt/li&gt</li>
<li>&ltli&gt unordered &lt/li&gt</li>
<li>&ltli&gt list &lt/li&gt</li>
</ul>
<p>&lt/ul&gt</p>

<br>

<p>&ltol&gt</p>
<ol>
<li>&ltli&gt this &lt/li&gt</li>
<li>&ltli&gt is &lt/li&gt</li>
<li>&ltli&gt an &lt/li&gt</li>
<li>&ltli&gt ordered &lt/li&gt</li>
<li>&ltli&gt list &lt/li&gt</li>
</ol>
<p>&lt/ol&gt</p>


<h1>a:</h1> The a container holds links to other places. It could be a webpage on the internet or a webpage that you made. You can even go to a different section of the webpage that you are on with the help of the id attribute. The id attribute, like the declaration tag, is less like a container and more like a sign.

<br>

&lta href="https://www.richlandlibrary.com"&gt<a href="https://www.richlandlibrary.com" target="_blank"> This is a Link to the Libraries Website </a>&lt/a&gt
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>Yay! We have some basic tags or container types under our belts, lets add some substance to our body container. I do not want you to have to guess about what to do on your first web page. So just Type This Way! You know, like the song. You know the song, walk this way, talk this.....you don't know the song? Ok just type what I have typed up down below:</p>
