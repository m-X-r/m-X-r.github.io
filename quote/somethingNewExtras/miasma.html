<li> interred: verb past tense: interred; past participle: interred place (a corpse) in a grave or tomb, typically with funeral rites. "he was interred with the military honors due to him"</li>

<li>"For coastal communities it was also customary to decorate the sides of the grave with seashells, especially white shells. This signified the transition to the world of the dead, which was connected to the world of the living by water or by the ocean. Many of these Bantu customs were later continued by the slave communities in the Americas, who kept some of these traditions for several centuries."</li>
<li>"The people of the Mimbres culture, which flourished in present-day New Mexico between 750 and 1200, buried their dead under the floors of their stone and adobe houses. A distinctive feature of Mimbres graves is the frequent placement of a painted pottery bowl over the head of the corpse. Each bowl had a hole punched through it before inclusion in the grave. Archaeologists speculate that this act was intended to “kill” the object and release its spirit into the afterlife to accompany the soul of the dead person. Another possibility is that the pot with its hole over the head symbolized the emergence of the deceased into the next world."</li>

<li>"At the time of the Spanish invasion in 1527, the Inca of all classes regarded their dead as ongoing members of the community whose advice was sought for daily matters by the living. Many tombs therefore remained open for continued access."</li>

<li>"On the level of royalty the mummies of Inca emperors were treated like living rulers, carried in processions to state events, and allowed to retain their palaces and treasure. The specialists who maintained the mummies (and who consumed all the offerings made to the dead rulers) became a very powerful caste, rivaling living emperors in influence. The last Inca emperor, Atahualpa (r. 1532), attempted to destroy the power of the mummy retainers, who had opposed his accession in the civil war that followed his father's death. The Spanish conquistadors completed the task, eventually burning the royal mummies as idols as part of their campaign of forcing the population to convert to Roman Catholicism."</li>

<li>"Although it was known from earlier historical records, the Hindu practice of suttee became more widespread in India during the sixth century, particularly among the Rajput court. The act of suttee was the voluntary self-immolation of a widow or concubine left with no sons upon her husband's death. Suttee was practiced by royalty and commoners, and in Rajputana several memorials were erected to commemorate the deaths of women who died on their dead husbands’ funeral pyres".... SELF- IMMOLATION: noun:
the action of setting fire to oneself, especially as a form of protest or sacrifice.</li>

<li>"In the eighth century the Parsis from Iran introduced new mortuary practices to India. Instead of cremation or interment, which were believed to pollute the fire and the earth, they placed their dead in dakmas (“towers of silence”). Ideally situated on hills where vultures had easy access to the corpses, these towers were several levels tall and had exposed chambers in which the dead were placed by ritual bearers. After the bones were cleaned and dried by animals and the sun, they were placed in a central chamber with a stone floor where they were naturally pulverized by the sun and rain. At the end of this process, any remaining bones were buried, but no tomb or monument was constructed in commemoration."</li>

<li>"Jar burials also have been discovered in Korea, usually composed of a large and a small jar placed mouth to mouth to contain the full body of the deceased. The jar burials are found clustered atop keyhole-shaped or square earthen mounds. Jar burials had few grave goods, suggesting that they probably were not linked to social status. Jar burials also have been found in Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia. These large, lidded burial jars contained fragmentary skeletal remains of one or several individuals, some of whom may have been cremated, along with incised smaller vessels, metal jewelry, beads, and tools. Near the Sulu and Celebes seas in Southeast Asia jar burials were secondary burials, where the bones of the deceased had been cleaned and prepared elsewhere and then placed communally in the vessels. Small decorated vessels, metal objects, beads, and jewelry accompanied these burials."</li>

<li>ossuary: noun: plural noun: ossuaries
a container or room in which the bones of dead people are placed.</li>

<li>" When many bodies had to be buried quickly–such as after a battle or during an epidemic–mass pits were used. This could occur after a battle or during an epidemic, as was the case during the Black Death (bubonic plague) in Europe in the mid-14th century. Some societies, mainly on the Continent and especially in the Mediterranean, adopted the custom of burying people in a mass grave until the bodies decomposed and then exhuming the bones and storing them in ossuaries–which might be as large as a building or as small as a chest. The Sedlec ossuary, a Roman Catholic chapel beneath the Church of All Saints at Sedlec, a suburb of the town of Kutná Hora in the modernday Czech Republic, contains some 40,000 skeletons believed to date to the 13th century."</li>






. . . . . " Death is universal, according to the Koran, but not all humans are aware of their mortal reality. In a sense, the human understanding of death can be said to take one of two forms: either rejection or acceptance of a hereafter, a notion often associated with belief in an omnipotent God. By the tenets of Islam, death should be considered at all times and viewed as merely a crucial stage in the preparation of the soul for the day of resurrection, when good souls shall be granted eternal life in heaven; unbelievers, by contrast, will suffer eternal torment in the fires of hell after their death on the earth. Free will plays a central role in this eschatological concept of death, since individuals are understood to choose their fates–and, at times, their deaths–through their behavior in the earthly world. However, predestination, too, figures in the Islamic notion of death, since both believers and unbelievers can experience their mortality in relation to the power of divine will. Thus, the destiny that ultimately determines the death and life of a human being can be understood to rest in God."
. . . . . "Central to the Koranic concept of resurrection is the belief that the decomposed, scattered corpses of the deceased will be recomposed for the Day of Judgment. The ritual treatment of the corpse, accordingly, has played a significant role in Islamic history, especially in the medieval period. As with birth and marriage, medieval Muslims held diverse attitudes toward death, such that various practices were employed in the treatment of the corpse."
. . . . . "The Sunni theologians’ disapproval of certain funerary ceremonies, including wailing and the performing of prayers over graves, was in fact a direct assault against the spread of Shia Islam in the 10th and 11th centuries. Since Shiism promoted the culture of martyrdom, including the ceremonies of wailing and tomb building for the deceased–in particular, for the holy imams whom Shiites believed were martyred by the Sunni caliphs–Sunni theologians found political motives for imposing greater restrictions on funerary proceedings. Such regulations thus served the purpose of distinguishing Shia and Sunni communities, with the latter considering themselves alone to be the true Muslims. The politics of tomb and shrine building played a predominant role in the shaping of medieval Muslim communities, as Shia and Sunni theologians debated the sanctity of funerary architecture, making reference to various collections of Hadith literature. In the medieval Islamic world funerary ceremonies became not only major theological concerns, regarding the proper Islamic manner for the burial of the deceased, but also political statements for various Muslim communities seeking to legitimize their Islamic identities."
