<h3>Something New for June 15th 2021 Tuesday</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking" target="_blank">Public speaking</a> was traditionally considered to be a part of the art of PERSUASION, or (SOCIAL) INFLUENCE or an attempt to influence a persons beliefs, attitudes, intentions, motivations, or behaviors. </p>

<p>Harvard psychologist Herbert Keleman Id three broad varieties of social influence. 
<ul>
<li>Compliance is when people appear to agree with others but actually keep their dissenting opinions private.</li>
<li>Identification is when people are influenced by someone who is liked and respected, such as a famous celebrity.</li>
<li>Internalization is when people accept a belief or behavior and agree both publicly and privately.</li>
</ul>
public speaking for business and commercial events is oft done by professionals that can be contracted independently, or thru representation by a SPEAKERS BUREAU aka a collection of speakers who talk about a particular subject OR A COMPANY WHICH OPERATES TO FACILITATE SPEAKERS FOR CLIENTS.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_bottle
" target="_blank">Impossible bottles</a> are ships in a bottle or more like a bottle containing an object that does not appear to fit through the bottles mouth. ship traditional and most iconic but others include fruits (stick bottle over flower and let pear grow inside.) matchboxes. decks of cards, tennis balls, racketballs, rubiks cubes padlocks, knots and scissors. They maybe placed inside using various mechanisms including construction inside bottle, using a small object that expands or grows inside the bottle (pinecones that expand when drying. or molding the glass around the object.</p>

<p><a href=" https://lizzadromuseum.org/puzzle-ball/" target="_blank">Chinese puzzle balls aka devils work balls</a> is an artifact that consists of a number of intricately carved concentric hollow spheres carved from a single block that fit within one another in a way that looks impossible, typically made of ivory.  usually made from a single solid ball with conical holes frilled in it with the carver separating the different spherical shells using l shaped tools.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/puzzle-balls-from-guangzhou" target="_blank">germans</a> tried to rip off the chinese puzzle balls (cuz of course they did) but they were not nearly as good. (cuz of course they weren't). But that did insipre me to see if i could also do a bad job at it maybe. I mean you can get <a href="https://www.tooltique.co.uk/shop/crown-hand-tools-chinese-ball-puzzle-dave-springett-woodturning-chisels/ " target="_blank">l shaped tools</a> on amazon right?</p>
