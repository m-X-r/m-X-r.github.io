<h1> MxR Studios </h1>

<p>
I am Jessica, or Jcoop, or Repooc_todj, or Mam occasionally. I started coding by happenstance on day, after I swore off everything IT. This evolved into me making text-based RPG games using HTML. One day I hope to take these HTML games and use Unity to make real RPG games. </p>
<p> 
That day is probably not today. Check out what I got going so far below.
</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
