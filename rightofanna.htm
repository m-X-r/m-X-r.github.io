The House to the Right of Anna's house
</h1>

<p>

You go to the house to the right of Anna's house. The lights are on upstairs and {redacted}'s XBox may be upstairs. Maybe they are the type of person who makes it look like all they do is read downstairs and never use the internet. Thats cool. You ring the doorbell and the door opens. You see a large wooden plackard that says 'Welcome to the Library" in big fancy letters. 

<ul>
   <li>Go inside, you have a library card, it might work here right   <a href="intothelibrary.htm">}={</a></li>

   <li>Go inside, you wouldn't mind getting a library card   <a href="intothelibrary.htm">}={</a></li>

<li>Yeah...If this is {redacted}'s house, ur good, because this is also exactly how horror movies start. Also if you door opens as soon as the doorbell rings you are either asking for it or asking to give it either way, someone dies. Bye Felicia   <a href="walkawayfrombrary.htm">}={</a></li>
