You go to the house across from Anna's house. All the lights are on, this has to be {redacted}'s house. You can almost taste some good home cooking and the sweet sweet taste of xBox victory. You ring the doorbell and you hear a voice inside say Welcome, please come in.

   <li>You reply, coming, but then punk out and run back to your car   <a href="runbacktocar.htm">}={</a></li>

   <li>You kick open the door and proclaim duh duh, duh duh, duh duh, the champ is here! <a href="champintohotel.htm">}={</a></li>
