Back Yard

<p>
You are in the back yard of Anna's house. You see Crocodile, you should say hello. What do you want to do?

<a href="launchpad.htm">
Go Forward
</a>

<a href="backdoor.htm">
Go Backwards
</a>

<a href="workshop.htm">
Go Right
</a>

<!--I am going to try and add an input function here but dont know if i can link it later to collect croc
say hello to croc OR say nothing...if i can i want to make it where if you dont say hello you dont see the option to go to the launchpad, but that would imply that you have to click an option before other options show up and i dont know what that is even-->
