<h1>
No,No. The Library
</h1>

<p>
You wip out your library card and hand it to the obvious librarian. They dont take it out your hand, you aren't even sure that they looked at it. They just say, oh so sorry sir, that card will not work here. You need The Library Card to check out books here at The Library. 
<ul>  
   <li>Oh, well since I have A Library Card can I just use the internet for five minutes?  <a href="guestpasspleaseinperson.htm">}={</a></li>

   <li>Oh, worth a shot. So how can I get a The Library Card? <a href="intoalibrarycard.htm">}={</a></li>

   <li>I DONT HAVE TIME FOR THIS! Just give me a card! I have someplace to be! <a href="ohreallyintoalibrarycard.htm">}={</a></li>
