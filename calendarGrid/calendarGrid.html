<li>I picked up my magic the gathering cards from Historic Columbia (bluegrass auction haul 2023) Im low key excited about sleeving them up and learning to play. (update: Prob should not have sleeved them all seeing as how I need all decks to be in the same sleeve)</li>

<li>I finally went to the fair. Amanda used her press pass (she didnt want to go) and I got fair ducks. I wanted one but had to get 3. we walked around. I saw dolls winning sweater and ate some fried mushrooms and ice cream. I bought fair pins but cant find the ones I got last year. And we all road the overhead lift thing Amanda had never been on it.</li>

<li>SOMETHING I CANT READ IN WHITE : looks like arson in place of official wil?</li>

<h1>FRIDAY</h1>
<ul>
<h3>2023</h3>
<li>Overdue 2023 fall. I ran the bookbinding program it was busy the entire time and the volunteers were no help at all. I guess it was cool and ppl seemed to enjoy themselves a little in my space. Really I was just running around a lot. </li>

<li>So some dominion (former sce&g) guy came to our house a few weeks back. didnt leave a note or call. today apparently construction ppl were digging a hole in the driveway one pushed on the fence. I went over at lunch they were doing something all the way around the block. I asked if they needed to get back there they said we dont speak english then white men came and said no we dont need to didnt take my number and said they were waiting on somoen from the city. less than 10 minutes later some guy has broken into the back yard I go over and coplain and hes like I needed to get back there I said I was just here and they said you didnt also when you came you didnt leave a note or call WTF mom was pissed talking about sueing dominion this guy is like im not worried but later appologized profusley to her. its a hot ass mess that triggered both mom and my trigger after being robbed that one time. (update: was the beggining of the super depressed fall into candle burning paperclip under the dragon actions)</li>

<li>I have been feeling like doing something else besides working at the library but didnt know what. Thought what else would I like to do all day. All this building and fixing of bathrooms has me thinking working with my hands and diving would be cool. Googled diving jobs and came up with commercial diving. could it be a thing for me? idk anything about it but a little excited I am. </li>

<li>I drove to greenvile. Went the long way across the dam and got on a freeway near chapin. Didn't have to deal with the standstill traffic from w.cola to the mall though. Went to see my second musical of the season Funny Girl. It was "boring" but that lady sung her tail OFF and made it better. Tanisha seemed more focused (less high maybe) everyone there likes her (she works there but that dont mean ppl have to like you) Good trip wish didnt have to rush back for avas cheer comp just the diving this afternoon. </li>

<h1>SATURDAY</h1>
<ul>
<h3>2023</h3>
<li>I worked on the chicken coop all day with mom again. She mostly just watched and tried to find stuff to do. I was supposed to take the "rooster" back to the farm but I smashed/cut my finger with the jigsaw using it wrong to cut a hole for the chicken door. (update: it was just a big hen but they took it back and gave me a different one anyway)</li>

<li>Underwater Pumpkin Carving. Mom came and watched Jeremy won first place! it was cool.and the BBQ was good too. After mom wanted to to go michaels and I got new yarns for the chicken army. </li>

<li>I was diving with sam or her last weekend here and marty was my buddy. we went on a coffer dam run and he was having issues. He just flew up and away and I followed with my light on him.(it was really dark) and went up as fast. Sam and Robert said I was dive buddieing harder than anyone they have ever seen or been with as a buddy but I should protect myself before my buddy aka should have done a saftey stop/not flew up with Marty. I didnt want him to be in the dark (he didnt have a light) and having issues and alone that would SUCK.</li>
