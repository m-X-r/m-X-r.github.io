<h1>
Happy New Years!
</h1>

<p>
You decided for your new year resolution you were going to put yourself out there, so you joined a dating app. You figured it was just a fluke but the day you planned to delete the app you had to work late. When you logged in you saw you had a match. Just for funzies you decided to reply and ironically enough you guys hit it off. You have been talking to {name redacted due to privacy issues} for three months online and you both have decided its past due time you meet IRL. {letâ€™s just call them redacted} invites you over for a home cooked meal and a lively Xbox competition. You agree. Tonight, is the night. {redacted} told you that you should go old school and print out some google directions to their house as cell signal is known to be spotty, because the house is near a cell tower ironically. You get your directions, and drive to the neighborhood in question, park in front of {redacted}'s house, are you ready?
