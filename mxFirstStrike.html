<li>Goal:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>The smallest part of my dream project that will give me a sense of accompolishment is to FINISH SOMETHING! </li>
	</ul>
<li>Message:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>I will finish something and ADD A LINK TO ON ON MY HOMEPAGE</li>
	</ul>
<li>Feed-Back:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Once I finish something I WILL SHARE IT WITH SOMEONE AND AWAIT FEEDBACK.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Milestones:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>dates are going to freek me out. I will work on it until I have something and make a tally of have somethings here</li>
	<li>TALLY: <span style="color:yellow;"> I </span></li>
	</ul>
<li>Evaluation:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>At the beginning of this first strike what did I envision its success looking like a game involving text and clicking with a compelling plot that made you want to win. even though I have no idea what winning is yet.</li>
	<li style="color:yellow;">After my first tally mark I have the end of something that took me a long time to complete. Even thought its not fully complete its a start. In the process I have started some new projects and Im developing a method-ology (is that a word?) that will allow me to move faster in the future maybe. I also took all the not finished-ish things off my homepage for now until they are more finished-ish</li>
