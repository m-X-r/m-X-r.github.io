<h1> A Really Big Window </h1>

<p>
You are at a really big window. looking out you can see a big blue sculpture.</p>

<p>You drove past it on the way into the parking lot, but didn't really look at it.</p>

<p>Looking at it now,  it almost reminds you of the beach. Why is it here? Was this a beach front in the past? Is this some weird art statement on capitalism?</p>

<p>You walk away feeling like you are missing some high level of learning. One that everyone else has that allows them to understand this sculpture, also, that you should defiantly read more.
