<h1>The Front Desk </h1>

<p>
You go to the front desk to book a room. At the desk the librarians are talking to a very smilely lady. You tell them about the canning club and ask if you can book a room to meet in. The smiley lady introduces herself to you. Her name is Melanie and she thinks that your event sounds like fun.  She then asks if she can come to the event. The librarians at the desk give you a sort of look, you cant figure out what it is about.
