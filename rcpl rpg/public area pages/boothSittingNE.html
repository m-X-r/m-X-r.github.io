<h1> A Booth? </h1>

<p>
You come across a booth. Like the kind you find in restaurants.</p>

<p>Pretty sure you saw a big one like this in a corner at Olive Garden. The only difference is that this one is nicer, and the one at Olive Garden didn't include a bunch of teens staring at you.</p>

<p> As soon as you walked up, they all stop what they are doing and started staring at you. My Bad didn't mean to interrupt you say to them. One in the back gives you a nod and says, "It's cool."</p>
