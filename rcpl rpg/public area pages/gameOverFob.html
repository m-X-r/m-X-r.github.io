Before you can do anything, someone comes out of the door and bumps into you. The librarian that walked out closes behind them but not all the way. </p>

<p>You swear you saw something like a torch before it shut. "Sorry," they say, "did you need some help." You stand there holding your hand out. Then you start to stutter, I want inside?</p>

<p> The librarian looks at you, " I'm sorry you can't go inside. This area is for staff only." You stutter some more, In, me, staff.</p>

<p> Suddenly a wild urge takes over you, and you attempt to plow past the librarian to see what was behind the door. It slams hard in your face.</p>

<p> When you awaken, you are outside and banned from the library.</p>
