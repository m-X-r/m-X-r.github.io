<h1>A Locked Room </h1>

<p>
You see a conference room type area and decide to try and go inside. The door won’t budge so you jiggle the handle. No change, you jiggle the handle harder.</p>

<p> The door makes a shaking sound, next thing you know a librarian is behind you. </p>

<p>“Did you need help with something?”</p>

<p> Yes, you say, I want to go inside.</p>

<p> “Sorry this is a staff area, that whys its locked, and has a sign that says staff only. Did you need help with something else?”</p>

<p> You now notice the large staff only sign directly in front of your face and you are wondering how you can wiggle out of this jam. Just checking, you say louder than you need to, seems like you have passed. The librarian gives you a look, as you walk away.</p>
