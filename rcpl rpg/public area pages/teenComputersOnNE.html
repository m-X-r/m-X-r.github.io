<h1> Teen Computers </h1>

<p>
You sit down to try and log in, just for the specialty log in experience.</p>

<p>Before you can even start to type a teen walks over, and informs you that these computers are for teens.</p>

<p>You have just begun to inform the teen that you are grown and can do what you want, when a librarian walks over and informs you that these computers are for teens.</p>

<p>The librarian adds that there are plenty of adult computers currently available that you can log onto. Also that you get more time per session on adult computers than teen computers anyway.</p>

<p>You have continued to type while the librarian was talking, just to make the log in experience count. Now you can leave a victor.</p>
