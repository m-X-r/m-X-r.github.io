<h1> The StoryTime Room </h1>

<p>
You are in the Storytime Room, you know this because a small child has asked you why Storytime is currently not happening in the Storytime room.</p>

<p>The room itself seems whimsical and full of creative potential with its walls painted with windows and doors to nowhere, but also everywhere.</p>

<p>There is a very tangible mystical vibe in this room.</p>
