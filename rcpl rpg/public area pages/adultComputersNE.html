<h1> Computer Floor </h1>

<p>
You are standing in the midst of a bunch of computer "pods". All around you are groups of four computers. Each group consists of a desktop computer, keyboard, mouse, table and a chair. The four tables are curved so when pushed up next to each other they make a circular pod. At each pod station there is a sign that says no food or drink. Also, a sign that says no cell phone calls. As you see the sign someoneâ€™s cell phone rings, and they answer it. You decide to sit down to use a computer. Once you are in the chair you notice you need a library card number and pin to log on.</p>
