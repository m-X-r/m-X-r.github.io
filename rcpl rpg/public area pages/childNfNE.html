<h1> Tinnier Spined Children’s Books </h1>

<p>
You are walking through some shelves with more of those books with tiny spines. You know from previous experience, that tiny spines on books = children. The last time you saw the tiny spine books was in the children’s picture books section.</p>

<p>Are these picture books too? You pick on up. It’s about drawing animals. You pick up another one. Its about the history of clay.  Seems like nonfiction books, but for children.</p>

<p>Why do the spines have to be so small! Is it because children have small hands?</p>

<p> There are so many more books in this nonfiction section than there were in the picture book section. And the spines, the spines go even smaller! This section is giving you a headache, time to go.</p>
