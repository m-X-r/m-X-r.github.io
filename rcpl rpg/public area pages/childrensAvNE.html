<h1> Childrens Multimedia Materials </h1>

<p>
You are standing in front of some shelves. There are a lot of kid shows and movies on DVD and blue ray.</p>

<p> You are looking through the titles, weird they have a whole Disney section.  Then you see it, the entire Harry Potter Series! </p>

<p>You hear about Harry Potter all the time, and nod and smile, but you have never actually read the books or saw the movies. WIFI is open in the library so you jump on your phone to look up to see how many movies there are and what they are called.</p>

<p> I might have to have a HP weekend you think looking around, but, I donâ€™t want everyone to know. Hum, maybe I will sneak grab these.
