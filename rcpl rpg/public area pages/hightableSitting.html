<h1> The High Table</h1>

<p>
You see 12 people standing around a very high table, having a conversation. When they see you, they stop talking and stare at you.</p>

<p> You donâ€™t like the way they are looking at you so you decide to walk away.</p>

<p> As you turn to leave you are sure you heard one of them "I have served. I will be of service." Something about that reminds you of Keanu Reeves.</p>
