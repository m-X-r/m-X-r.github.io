You walk over and start touching the panel. The lights in the building start getting brighter, then darker, then off, then back on, then off again.</p>

<p> Suddenly the library security guard is behind you. They ask what you are doing. You reply trying to pull up Netflix on this projector! Security lets you know that you cannot do that.</p>

<p> They then walk you to the front desk and highlights on a calendar the next time NE will be having a movie night.</p>

<p> They also kindly let you know you are banned until then.
