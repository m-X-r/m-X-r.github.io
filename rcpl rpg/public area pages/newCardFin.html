<h1> The Front Desk </h1>

<p>Congratulations!</p>

<p>The librarian hands you a Richland County Library Card.</p>

<p>They then proceed to start to tell you about all the services now available to you. A lot of words were said, you tuned out after the first few.</p>

<p> You tuned back in because you thought you heard the word woodshop, but then another customer jumped in front of you to ask for something.</p>

<p> Thanks, you say to the librarian, though you donâ€™t know if they noticed.</p>

<p> That new customer seemed a little demanding.</p>
