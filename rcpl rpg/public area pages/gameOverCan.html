<p>
After you tell Melanie she can't come, she says ok and walks off.</p>

<p> You try and continue booking a room, but now for whatever reason, there are problems with your booking. You stay at the Front Desk for what seems like thirty minutes trying to book a room, but no matter what you try, nothing seems to work.</p>

<p> You go back and tell your fellow canning enthusiast that you could not book a room. They seem to feel like meeting at each other's houses was fine, and they didn't understand why you would want to meet at the library in the first place. A significant argument ensues where your canning ability is questioned and insulted.</p>

<p> I don't have to take this type of punishment you announce. I'm going home! With that, you storm out exactly like Urkle in Family Matters.</p>

<p> Like really, all you needed to make it better was some suspenders.</p>
