<p>
"I did, so could you move?" they say, pushing past you. </p>

<p>The stranger is gathering up pages that are waiting to be picked up. Then they start gathering pages that are in the process of printing. Suddenly you hear someone else says, "Hey, some of those might be mine!"</p>

<p> Someone else walks over, and they start to sort through the pages together. "Could you move?" the new person asks you.</p>

<p> You leave feeling like a third wheel.</p>
