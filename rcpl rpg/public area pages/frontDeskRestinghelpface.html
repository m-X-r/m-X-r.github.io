<h1> The Front Desk  </h1>

<p>
"Ok." The librarian says, as they continue to smile and stare at you.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s almost as if the librarian has entered your soul through your eyes, it makes you a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you feel a loud voice in your head screaming LEAVE! Only it's a low and raspy scream. Every syllable is held out longer than necessary, and the sound hurts your head a little. It feels like nails scratching the chalkboard of your skull. </p>
<p> It's just a little too weird for you, so you walk away, just a little afraid. </p>
<p> Was my soul just invaded? You ponder as you walk away.</p>
