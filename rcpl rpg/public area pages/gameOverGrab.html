<p>
You grab all the cool titles you see and go to check out. </p>

<p>The self-check out is still being worked on so you go to the front desk. The librarian at the desk tells you that you canâ€™t check any of the cool books you saw out. They say that those cool books are all for other people.</p>

<p>You disagree, loudly, or as you like to think passionately.</p>

<p>The cops that come after security called them because you started throwing thinks think differently.
