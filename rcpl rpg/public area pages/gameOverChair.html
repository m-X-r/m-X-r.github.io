<p>
You run into the back of a chair that you realize as you are slamming into it has someone sitting in it. You knock the staff member over as you also fall over.</p>

<p> Next thing you know, you are heading towards a bright light through a tunnel of darkness.</p>

<p> See what had happened was. On the way down, you hit your head against the corner of the desk at a weird angle. Though the paramedics got there very quickly, you were D.O.A.</p>

<p> On your tombstone, they wrote, "Not the best library patron, but definitely not the worst. R.I.P"</p>
