<h1> The Bathroom </h1>

<p>
You walked into a restroom, apparently, it’s the Women’s restroom because there is a lady standing by the sink.</p>

<p>This lady has a sweatband on with super short shorts and knee-high socks.  Like the knee-high socks that are white and have the three bands up towards the top. She seems to be limbering up when she sees you.</p>

<p>Her eyes light up when she sees you and she enthusiastically starts a conversation.</p>
