<h1> More Teen Books </h1>

<p>
You walked away from those other teen books you were looking at because an adult walked by. You did not like the look they gave you. It was probably just the way their face looked, and they probably were not even looking at you, but still.</p>

<p>Now you find yourself in front of some more teen books. You wish you would have picked up that book that teen was telling you about, then you see a book called The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas on display.</p>

<p>Didn't they make a movie of that? Wasn't the movie popular? Maybe I should check this out, read it and then watch the movie you think.</p>
