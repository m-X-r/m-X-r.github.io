"You need to go to the kiosk behind me. Then you can scan your card under the monitor and type in your four-digit pin on the touchscreen." The librarian said.</p>

<p> "Next, you need to select the print job you sent. From there, you can pick black and white or color. You can also pick the number of copies of the total job you need." </p>

<p>The librarian paused for a second to see if I got what she had just said. My eyes said no, so she continued. </p>

<p>"So if your job is two pages long and you want two copies, that will be four pages. You get ten free pages a day, and then it will be 25 cents per page after that." Got it, thanks, you reply. </p>
