<h1> The Other Bathroom </h1>

<p>
You walked into a restroom, apparently, it’s the Men’s restroom because there is a guy standing by the sink.</p>

<p>This guy has a sweatband on with super short shorts and knee-high socks.  Like the knee-high socks that are white and have the three bands up towards the top. He seems to be limbering up when he sees you.</p>

<p>His eyes light up when he sees you and he enthusiastically starts a conversation.</p>
