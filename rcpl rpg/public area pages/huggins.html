<h1>A Large Conference Type Room </h1>

<p>
Its Canning Club Meeting day!</p>

<p> You brought your hotplate  to do a demo on canning watermelon and everyone loved it, especially Melanie! You didn’t think she would come, but she did. She asked lots of questions and participated the whole time. At the end of the meeting, she pulled you aside. </p>

<p> She explains how much she loved the demo, and how she wants you to do it again for the library. She says she is on the Executive Leadership Team of the library and loves community partnerships. Then her phone buzzes.</p>

<p> She looks at her phone for a minute after excusing herself, then she comes back. She says she must run, but if you send her an email something can get set up.</p>

<p> She insists that you grab a bookmark at the front desk to get to her email address. Right as she is leaving she gives you something, it’s a black flat disk with a key ring on it.</p>

<p> This will get you where you need to go, I’m giving it to you in good faith she says, with that she rushes off to whatever appointment her phone called her to. </p>
