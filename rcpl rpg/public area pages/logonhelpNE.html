"To log in you will need to type in your library card number first. Your card number is on the back of your card under the barcode. Make sure to type the whole number, and be sure to type it into the library card number field on the screen."</p>

<p>  Though some of that seems obvious to you, it must not be to most people. The way the librarian is rattling the info off, is like its a memorized speech. People must have a lot of trouble logging in.</p>

<p> "Next, you need to type your four-digit pin into the pin field on the screen and click submit. Once you click submit the computer will prompt you to accept the library policy and reenter your pin. Be sure to enter the same pin that you entered on the previous screen."</p>

<p> Why would I enter in a different pin you ask softly, the librarian does not notice and keeps going.</p>

<p> "As long as the information is correct the computer will unlock to the desktop and you will be able to use it."</p>

<p> Before you can reply someone trying to log into their computers yells for the librarians help. They want to know what their second pin number is. She gets up to go help them.</p>

<p> Well, you think, guess you canâ€™t assume the obvious. </p>
