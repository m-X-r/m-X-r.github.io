<h1> A Large Conference Room</h1>

<p>
You walk into a large room. It has lots of tables and chairs. The kicker is it also has multiple sinks.</p>

<p> You see a lady you are guessing works here sliding some white panels at the North end of the room.</p>

<p> Behind her, you see a big sink and what looks like a stove and an oven. That has to be the source of the delicious smell you've been inhaling since you walked in.</p>
