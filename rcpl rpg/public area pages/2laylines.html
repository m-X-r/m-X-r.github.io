<h1> The Parking Lot </h1>

<p>
You jump in your car and notice a flyer on your windshield. The brochure says Mr. Seafood, delicious seafood, in big, bold letters. Hum, you think seafood would be excellent. You decided to head out to get some.</p>

<p>You drive off to Mr. Seafood's and get a whitefish basket to go. As you are leaving, you see Sunshine Thrift Store. Suddenly you remember needing a CD player for something.</p>

<p>You pull into the parking lot of the thrift store. You debate eating your fish now, even though it is scorching from being freshly fried or eating it after you look around the thrift store.</p>
