<h1> Large Print Stacks </h1>

<p>
You standing in front of books labeled Large Print. They look like other books on the shelf, what makes them special.</p>

<p> You see a book you have on your shelf at home, and decided to flip through it to see what the difference is. When you get it in your hand you realize that your copy is not nearly as thick as this one. When you open it up you find that it has bigger type than yours, much bigger type!</p>

<p>An older lady walks up beside you and asks if you are going to check it out. You tell her no while handing it over to her. She smiles and heads to the front desk to check out.</p>
