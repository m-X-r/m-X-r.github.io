<h1> Large Round Table in the Cafe Area </h1>

<p>
You sit down at the table and before you know it someone else sits down as well. You notice they have a book about canning and food preservation.</p>

<p>You LOVE canning! like if you were not at the library now you would probably be canning something.</p>

<p>You strike up a conversation with your potential fellow canning enthusiast, and find out that they just joined a canning club! They give you a flyer for the next meeting. Itâ€™s at a members house.</p>

<p>To you, meeting at a strangers house is a little weird, and murder-esq. So, you suggest they book try and book a meeting room space at the library instead. </p>
