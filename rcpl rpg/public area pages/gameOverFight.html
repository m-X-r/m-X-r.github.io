The security guard that approaches you is a woman, she seems small and scrawny. You look at her name tag, it says Ashley.</p>

<p>No way are you going to let "Ashley" push you around, if that is even her real name!</p>

<p>You tell "Ashley" you aren't going anywhere. You tell her that there is no way a flash light punk fake cop like her is going to do anything about it either.</p>

<p>Ashley then punches you in the face.</p> 

<p>Looks like, YOU JUST GOT KNOCKED OUT!!!!!!!!!!</p>
