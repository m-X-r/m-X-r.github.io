<h1> Self Checkout </h1>

<p>
You get to the Self Checkout at NE, a little scared and excited to try it out.</p>

<p> Then you see it, the sign telling you it is out of order.</p>

<p> Then you hear it, a grunt as someone under the table messing with cords bumps their head. They turn and see you. They look over at the other self-checkout at someone on the floor there.</p>

<p> It's going to be a minute, they say, You can loop around and come back later, or you can check out at the Front Desk if you like.</p>
