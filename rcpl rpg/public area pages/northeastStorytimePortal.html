<h1> The Tiny StoryTime StoreRoom </h1>

<p>
The door unlocks! You walk into a tiny room full of children's toys.</p>

<p> Well, that was anticlimactic.</p>

<p>There is a chair in the corner of the tiny room. You feel a sudden inkling to sit down. Once you are seated the room fills with a very comforting haze. Suddenly it seems to be a great time to read a book.</p>

<p> Specifically a Story Time book.</p>

<p> One that you would probably find in the Story Time Collection. A Story Time Collection that would probably be in the Drive Thru-Area. A Drive Thru Area that is probably somewhere in the South-East direction of the Staff Area.</p>
