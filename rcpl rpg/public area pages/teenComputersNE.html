<h1> Lonely Computers </h1>

<p>
You bump into a chair and tables grouping. It's four computers in a circle on tables each with a chair. There were a bunch of these computer stations on the other side of the room, these are all alone.</p>

<p>Then you see 4 signs in those hard-plastic sign holder things that say, in big letters, that these computers are reserved for Teenagers.</p>

<p>So maybe they are not lonely, it seems they are specialist computers. You wonder for a second if specialist are lonely.</p>

<p>You look back at the special computers, itâ€™s been a while since you have been a teen, but, you have never been on a specialty computer...hum...</p>
