<h1> Books in Spanish </h1>

<p>
You see the spine of a book you know is Twilight, but the word twilight is in Spanish. After looking around you realize you are in the books written in Spanish section.</p>

<p> You didn’t know they had one of those, cool!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you didn’t study Spanish in school so you don’t know what anything says. At least not for real, only buy guesstimation.</p>

<p>You wonder what the Spanish word for guesstimation is.</p>
