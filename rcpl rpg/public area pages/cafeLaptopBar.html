<h1> Playstation Bar? </h1>

<p>
You are at a high table with bar chairs and neat retro hanging lights. You see someone sitting and working on their laptop on one end of the table.</p>

<p> Sitting in the middle you see a guy with a large screen TV and a PlayStation. You ask him what he is doing, I mean it’s not every day you see a guy with a PlayStation and a large screen TV in the library. He says he’s using the Wi-Fi to update his system.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, sure... is what you say to him. What you are thinking though is wow, they let people do that in here!</p>
