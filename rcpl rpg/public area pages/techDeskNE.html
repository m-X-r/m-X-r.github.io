<h1> Tech Help Desk </h1>

<p>
You are standing in front of a desk with a librarian sitting behind a computer looking at you "Did you need help with something?" they ask, as you look up and see a sign that says Tech Help Desk.</p>

<p>Must mean this is where you get help with technology, or were technology gets help with people. As you laugh to yourself the librarian ask you again if you need any help.</p>
