The more you consider having a Cafe Area that you canâ€™t have any Cafe in makes you mad. You ask for some blank paper and make some protest signs and start a protest in the Cafe Area.</p>

<p>Cafe means Food! Food Lives Matter! I have the right to use a straw! you yell!</p>

<p>You are still yelling as the mental health practitioners roll you out in a strait jacket. They were also nice enough to bring your signs so you can hang them on your wall in the institution you are going to.</p>
