<h1>Big Comfy Chairs </h1>

<p>
You see some colorful, big, comfy-looking chairs arranged in a conversation setting. You take a seat and find yourself looking into a large conference room with a kitchen at the end.</p>

<p> A lady walks out smiling at you. "Oh hey," she says, "We are about to start a cooking class. Would you like to join? It involves butter most wonderfully."</p>

<p> Butter does make things better, you think. </p>
