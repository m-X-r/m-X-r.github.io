<p>
You decide to drape your jacket over the table, so it hangs down. It won't stay, so you set a chair on top of the table to hold it. You then crawl under the small table and lay the chair on its side in front of you so the seat and back can block you from view.</p>

<p> All the while, A librarian at the front desk has been watching you. They walk into the room. "Have you reserved this room?" they ask.</p>

<p> Come to find out; you can not hang out in the room unless it is reserved. Even though you did not reserve the room, the librarian says you can stay until someone reserves it. Before the librarian leaves, they have one more thing to say.</p>

<p> "The thing is, you cant block yourself from view like this in our study rooms. I am going to need you to take apart this, structure you have built."  But I was just about to take a nap, you inform them. "Sorry, no sleeping in the library." The librarian replies.</p>

<p> I can't have any fun! You exclaim while crawling out from inside your makeshift fort, grabbing your jacket. You storm home and make a fort in your living room.</p>

<p> It's not nearly as fun or satisfying. </p>
