You are intrigued by this bathroom athlete. They start talking in depth about the benefits of exercise as well as slight humidity. Itâ€™s a longish tangent ending on the fact that working out in a bathroom is the best for cardio as well as respiratory health.</p>

<p> Sounds pretty convincing, so convincing in fact that you decide to join them in this exercise regime. Someone else walks into the bathroom while at about the halfway through point of the workout, and you invite them to join in.</p>

<p>They decline, leaving the bathroom all together, so you two continue. Just as yall all are finishing up security walks in and ask yall to leave.</p>

<p>Your exercise guru gets very upset. So, upset in fact that pretty soon the cops are in the restroom and a whole different exercise regime ensues.</p>

<p>Silver lining, while you two are in lockup you do find some new followers and start a whole new exercise regime.
