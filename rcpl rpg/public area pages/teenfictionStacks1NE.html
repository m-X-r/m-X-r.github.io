<h1> Teen Books Section?</h1>

<p>
You are looking at some intriguing titles on a shelf of books. A teen walks up beside you looking as well.</p>

<p> "Thatâ€™s a good one they say to you. I read it last summer." </p>

<p>You look at them and smile. Then you happen to look up and realize you are in the teen book section.</p>

<p> The teen sees you looking at the teen sign, then they say, "My mom read it too."</p>

<p>They wink as they grab a book and walk off. Maybe</p>
