"The scanning station is South East of me. It's a computer on a table with a scanner next to it." She says, pointing.</p>

<p>  "The scan program is up on the screen. Put your documents face up if you use the feed tray. Be sure to save your documents to the desktop so you can find them later. You can send your scan to the printer or attach it to an email. You can even save it to a personal flash drive if you have one. Once you are finished, be sure to log off the computer using the red log off icon on the desktop." </p>

<p>Sounds like a lot, you say to her.</p>

<p> "Well, if you need any help, once you are all set up, just let me know."</p>
