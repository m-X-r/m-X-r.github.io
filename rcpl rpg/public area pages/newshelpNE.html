<h1> Tech Help Desk </h1>

<p>
The librarian looks at you, then she turns and looks behind her. You look her right in the eye and repeat it.</p>

<p> Alexa. Whats. In. The. News! You say rather forcefully.</p>

<p> "I'm sorry, what's happening right now?" The librarian asks, slowly stepping from behind the desk looking around.</p>

<p>  I want to know the news! You say quite gruffly.  At this point, you have decided to commit to this endeavor 100%.</p>

<p> "I see...well... South-East of me you will find the newspapers...That's about all the news we have", she says. "Just be sure to put them back when you are done." You respond by saying, was that so hard! Gosh.</p>

<p> The librarian steps away for a second. Before you head off, you see a gaggle of librarians as well as the one you were messing with staring at you from afar.</p>
