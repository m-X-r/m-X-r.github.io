<h1> A Kitchen in a Library? </h1>

<p>
You walk back to the lady sliding the white panels. Hey, is that a stove? You ask.</p>

<p> "Sure is!" She replies, "We just finished up a cooking class. Be sure to check the website or the whiteboard upfront to see when our next class is."</p>

<p> She smiles and closes herself behind the white paneling. Cooking classes, fancy, you say to yourself in a french (Esq) accent. </p>

<p>You hear giggling from behind the panel. Oh, you say, I didn't think anyone was listening. "No problem, have a nice day," you hear come back at you from behind the panel.</p>
