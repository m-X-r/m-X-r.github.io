"You will need to go to the fax machine to the South-East of me." Said the librarian, pointing. "Above the fax machine, you will see the directions for operation printed." </p>

<p> As I began to walk towards the fax machine, the librarian started talking again.</p>

<p> "Just remember if the number is local you do not need to dial the area code first, otherwise dial one and then the area code and the number." Ok, I started to walk when she stopped me, yet again.</p>

<p> " Also, you need to watch for the screen to say complete as it will not print out a confermation sheet." Got it, I replied.</p>
