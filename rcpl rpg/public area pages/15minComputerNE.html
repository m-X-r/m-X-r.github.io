<h1> Solo Computer </h1>

<p>
You come across a computer all by itself. </p>

<p> Not in a solo group, near but not in the big computer section, just singular, off to the side, solo. You see a sign next to it that says 15-minute computer, thatâ€™s all it says. You guess maybe this one is only good for 15 minutes at a time. Why would they need that?</p>

<p> Suddenly a librarian is behind you.</p>

<p> "That computer is our 15-minute computer. If all the computers are in use you could jump on that one. Right now, though we have plenty of free computers if you would like to use one of our adult computers."</p>

<p>Next thing you know the librarian is gone.</p>
