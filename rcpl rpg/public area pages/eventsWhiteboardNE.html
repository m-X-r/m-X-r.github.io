<h1> NE Events Whiteboard </h1>

<p>
You are standing in front of a decorative Whiteboard. Written on it in fancy script and multiple colors, and even a few illustrations, are the times dates and titles of some upcoming events happening at this branch. You notice that a cooking demonstration is about to start, and no preregistration was required. Looks like butter is involved, you love butter, maybe you should go.</p>
