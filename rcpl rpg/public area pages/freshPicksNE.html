<h1> Books on Dispaly  </h1>

<p>
You see a bunch of books displayed on a table. In the middle of the table is a fancy sign that says Fresh Picks. What’s a fresh pick? You say it mostly to yourself but someone next to you answers.</p>

<p> "Fresh Picks all have this yellow sticker on the spine."</p>

<p> An older man next to you says, pointing at one of the yellow dot shaped stickers.</p>

<p> "That means it’s a fresh pick. You can’t put them on hold, or renew them, but it’s the best way to get a new popular book quicker than being on hold for it."</p>

<p> Oh, neat, thanks, you say. The old man kind of grunts and moves to look at the fresh picks on the other side of the table. You see a book with an interesting title by someone named Agatha Christie.</p>

<p> The old man sees you looking, "that’s a good one, just finished reading that one. Great for mystery," he says. Really, you reply, I’ll hold on to this, maybe I'll to check it out later you tell him.</p>
