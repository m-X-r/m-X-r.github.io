<h1> Books on CDs </h1>

<p>
You are now in front of a lot of Cd cases, but not like the single cases of the old days. These cases are thick and gray and when you opened one up there were like 20 disks inside.  Itâ€™s like Audible, but on Cd! </p>

<p>They have all kinds of books, Fiction, Mystery, Nonfiction, and....Western? They have western books on Cd! you say out loud by mistake.</p>

<p>After looking around and noticing that no one is paying you any attention you contemplate grabbing one. Who still has a cd player? Who listens to Westerns on Cd? So many questions!</p>

<p>Then an idea hits you, this could be the beginning of a thrift store search for a cd player! That could be fun, maybe I should check this out you think.</p>
