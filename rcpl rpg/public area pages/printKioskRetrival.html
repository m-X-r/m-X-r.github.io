<h1> The Kiosk </h1>

<p>
On the screen of the kiosk, it is asking for your library card number and pin. You notice a scanner under the monitor, so you scan your card and type your pin in.</p>

<p> You see that you can type in how many copies of each thing you sent to print that you want. You sent ten pics, so you only wish to the default one copy of each job. You are sure to select the non-default color for each print job because those bears deserve to be in color.</p>

<p> You hit send, and then you hear the printer startup.  Before you can move, someone waiting behind you has already logged you out and is sending their print job to the printer. </p>
