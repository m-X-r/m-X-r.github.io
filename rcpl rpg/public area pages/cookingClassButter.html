<h1> Cooking Class </h1>

<p>
You join in the Cooking Class. It just started. Shortly you learn the class is all about sauteing things with butter. You end up making sautéed onion, carrot and shrimp pasta with a white sauce. It turns out so delicious! Best of all, it’s not nearly as hard as you would have thought.</p>

<p>As the class is wrapping up you go to a sink to wash your hands on your way to grabbing a recipe sheet when you see something on the ground. It is a flat round disk with a keyring hooked onto it. It seems like someone may have dropped it.</p>
