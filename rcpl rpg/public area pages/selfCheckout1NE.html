<h1> Self Checkout </h1>

<p>
You get to the Self-Checkout. Oh, fancy you think. When did libraries start doing this? You hate to admit it, but you are a little scarred and excited to try it out.</p>

<p>Then you see it, a sign telling you it is out of order. Aww Man! you say out loud, then you hear a knock and a grunt. Suddenly someone appears from under the table rubbing their head.</p>

<p>They turn and see you. "That really hurt they say," followed by, "Sorry it's going be a minute. We have work to do on all the self-checkouts today." "If you are going to be browsing for a while you can loop around and come back later, or you can check out at the Front Desk." With that they crawl back under the table.</p>
