<h1> Music CDs</h1>

<p>
You are standing in front of a shelf of Compact Music Disks...COMPACT MUSIC DISKS!</p>

<p>Do people still even have access to Cd players? In your mind its like having a tape deck, or an 8-track player.</p>

<p>  Before you complete your thought, someone comes by and collects a stack of CDs.</p>

<p>As they leave to checkout I think you heard them say something about burning them for a friend...</p>

<p>.... to someone they were talking to on their flip cell phone.</p>
