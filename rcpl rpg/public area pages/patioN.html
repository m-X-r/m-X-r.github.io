<h1> The Patio </h1>

<p>
You walk through some bushes and end up beside a trash can. Looks like the staff parking lot. Someone was in the middle of getting into their car when you walked back there.</p>

<p> They sit for a while looking at you, you just stand there and stare at them.</p>

<p> Then they start looking at you and their phone simultaneously, you just keep staring.</p>

<p>  Next thing you know a security guard has walked out the back door and is staring at you too. You stare at them and the person in the car, back and forth, until the security guard walks over and lets you know that you need to leave.</p>
