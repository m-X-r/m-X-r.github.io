<h1>Mystery Books</h1>

<p>
You find yourself standing at the edge of a shelf of books. Sticking out right next to your face is a little plastic placeholder that has mystery printed on it. This must be the mystery section you think.</p>

<p> You see some more books by Agatha Christie on this shelf. You wonder if she is like an authority on mystery writing. Got to remember to Google her later you think. </p>
