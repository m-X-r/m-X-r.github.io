<h1> Big Comfy Chairs</h1>

<p>
No thanks, you say. I'm fine right here for now. "Ok," the lady replies as she goes off to ask others in the library if they want to join the class.</p>

<p>The chair is so comfy you sit there looking at your phone for what must have been twenty minutes or so.</p>

<p> Suddenly you smell the most beautiful smell wafting away from the class you just passed up. Maybe I should not have passed up on that class, you think. You have to get away from this smell. It is making you hungry with regret.</p>
