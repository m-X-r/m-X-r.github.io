<h1>Nursing Mothers Lounge </h1>

<p>
You come to a door with a sign on it that says Nursing Mothers Lounge. Is this like a “member’s only” bar or something?</p>

<p>You go to turn the nob when you see it has a red in use message on it. Like an airplane bathroom nob. What could that mean, beyond the obvious, you are thinking when a librarian walks by.</p>

<p>"Oh, she’s pumping in there, it is going to be a minute. If you want me to give her a message once she is done I can," He says.  No! I mean, no, you stammer.</p>

<p>Wow, they mean breast milk nursing, yeah, not a club you want to be a part of.</p>
