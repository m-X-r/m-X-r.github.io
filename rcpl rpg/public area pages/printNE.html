<h1> Print-poluza </h1>

<p>
What do I need to print you ponder?</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later you have found multiple of pictures of bears with top hats, some also have bowties. One bear has a top hat a bow tie and a monocle!</p>

<p>As you send each bear pic to print you see a little box pop up on your screen that says your job has been sent to the printer.</p>

<p>Once you send the tenth bear pic you sit back to be proud for a minute of the work that has been done before heading to the printer.</p>
