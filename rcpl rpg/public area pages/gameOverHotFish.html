<p>You attempt to pick up the hot fish, but it's too hot and burns your fingers. You manage to toss it in the air and catch it in your mouth.</p>

<p>The fish is so hot it burns your mouth, and upon trying to chew, hot grease flows down your throat. Most of it flows into your stomach, but some shimmies down the wrong pipe, frying your lungs.</p>

<p>Before you pass away, you do get to taste a bit of the fish. Worth it is your last thought. </p>
