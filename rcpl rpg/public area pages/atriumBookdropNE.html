<h1>Book Drop Room</h1>

<p>
You just walked in the front door, and now you are in a weird front door room.</p>

<p> There is a book drop to the left you along with a little stool. That's all there is in this space, just a book drop and a stool. There should at least be a coat rack and maybe an umbrella stand.</p>

<p> Before you can finish your thought, someone comes in the door behind you and asks you to move. They have a bag of books to drop into the dropbox, and you are in their way.</p>

<p> Guess that's why the space is so empty, you think as you walk off.</p>
