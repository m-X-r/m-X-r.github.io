<p>
You walk into a room with a plackard on the door that says Study Room 2. Inside is a TV monitor , some tables and chairs, and a sign thtat says you must reserve the room before using it. </p>

<p>Its a big space, and there is a door, those people standing around that high table probally could have a way better secret meeting in here.</p>

<p> Should I go mention it to them?</p>
