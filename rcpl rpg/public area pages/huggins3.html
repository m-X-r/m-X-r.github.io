<p>
You are now on the library’s homepage. How do I find her email address?</p>

<p>You decide to try the work with us tab, hoping to find a sort of meet the team link. Nothing, you do however find a job listing for a Network Systems Administrator. Pays well, but you know nothing about TCP/IP networking including VoIP.</p>

<p>Next you try the about tab, bingo! you see a link that says our team. When you click on it, three "teams" pop up, you start to wonder which one of these teams to pick. Then you see a picture of someone that looks kind of like Melanie interacting with a child. The picture is small, but you click it anyway. then you see a much bigger picture, with her name beside it, followed by Executive Director. Wow! You click on the link and get her email.</p>
