"Did you happen to memorize the number on the back of your old card?" The librarian asks</p>

<p>Who would do that! You say a little louder than you meant too.</p>

<p>"Lots of people," the librarian says. "I just asked because If I give you a replacement card it will change that number. People who memorized their numbers tend to not like that."</p>

<p>Ah, makes sense, you say. Well you can change mines, I never even thought about it. The librarian smiles, "ok, will do. I just will need your driverâ€™s license with your Richland County address on it."</p>
