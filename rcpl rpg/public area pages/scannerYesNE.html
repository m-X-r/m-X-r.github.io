<h1> Feel the Funk </h1>

<p>
You are brainstorming what to scan when a man comes over to you.</p>

<p>The guy has a shirt on featuring a band you havenâ€™t heard of. They look kind of wild in flashy outfits with guitars and whatnot.</p>

<p>The name on the shirt says Parliament Funkadelic.</p>

<p>You strike up a conversation with the man, asking him about the band. Turns out he is an expert on the Parliament Funkadelic band. So much so that he is their "unofficial" historian, he also has a tone of memorabilia connected to the band.</p>

<p>You get so caught up in his stories that you forget you ever had to scan at all.</p>
