<h1>The High Table</h1>

<p>
You walk back to the High Table and again everyone stops talking and starts staring at you.</p>

<p> Excuse me, you say, I see that there are a lot of you, and you seem to be having a meeting that seems a little confidential. I saw a sign in that room over there that said it was a study room. You can reserve it at the front desk for your meeting, instead of standing out here if you would like. They continue to stare at you. Well just thought I would try and help. Blank stares. Alright bye, you say, walking away.</p>

<p> Two steps into leaving you feel a hand on your shoulder. One of the people from the meeting has walked over to you.</p>

<p> "Thank you for your kindness in informing us of the room. For the next meeting we have me may make use of that space, as we did not know about it. Take this as a token of our gratitude", they say handing you a large gold coin with a skull on one side.</p>

<p> Thanks, you say looking down at the coin. When you look back up to ask what it is for you see they are all gone. Weird.</p>
