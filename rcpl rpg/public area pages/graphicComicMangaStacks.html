<h1> Comics </h1>

<p>
The sign above the section of books you are looking at says Adult Graphic Novels, Comics, and Anime, but you just call all of it comics.</p>

<p> Honestly you have no clue what the difference between comics and graphic novels. Manga you have heard of, you know they have something to do with Japan but not much else.</p>

<p> You pick up a manga, then you put it right back down, seems confusing. Pretty sure that was going back to front.</p>
