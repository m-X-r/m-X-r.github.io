<h1>Hotel Bruce</h1>

<p>
You are suddenly back in the Woodland Forest in front of that cottage you went inside before. Bruce and the geese are getting off the bus, bags in hand, walking towards the house.</p>

<p>Before they can make it to the door, it flies open, and three mice are standing, their arms outstretched to a sign above the door that says Welcome to the North Woods Hotel. The booming voice starts.</p>

<p>"In the Spring when Bruce came home, he found that mice had moved in and turned his house into the North Woods Hotel, a busy Woodland hotel, and he was not happy."</p>

<p>You then see actual steam coming from bruces ears.</p>
