<h1>Hotel Bruce</h1>

<p>
"Bruce's house was a quiet, peaceful place again, and there were no more visitors." The voice announces.

<p>You see Bruce finally relaxing in his recliner. Just as he begins to close his eyes, his children walk over to him. One sits in his lap, the other nudges his arm, and the third settles in on the back of his chair. The fourth goose waves its wings to get Mother Bruces' attention and then points out the window. Bruce got up to look out the window in the direction that his goose child was pointing. He saw the three mice, sitting on a rock in the middle of a rain puddle, looking very sad and lonely. Bruce released a big sigh and looked back to see all his geese giving him the cute sad eyes, the kind that says Pleeeeeeesssssseeeee.</p>

<p>Bruce couldn't resist those eyes, for the next thing the booming voice said was, "At least for a little while."</p>

<p>Bruce walked over to the front door and waived for the mice to come back inside. The next thing you see is Bruce napping in his recliner in front of the fire while his geese and the mice play board games. Then everything goes black. Bravo, you yell as you get up and take a big stretch. Suddenly you see a neon red exit sign floating in the air with a trash can is sitting next to it. There is also a door with some light shining through it.</p>
