<h1>This is not my Hat</h1>

<p>
The sizeable angry fish seems to be moving slow, but he reaches you in record time. The tip of his nose is almost touching the front of your diving mask.</p>

<p>He seems very angry, and as he is about to say something, he stops and looks down, down towards your right foot, down to see the crab pointing towards the underwater forest. The big fish turns to get a better look.</p>

<p>As soon as you, the big fish, and the crab are looking towards the underwater forest in unison, you hear a sound. It's the little fish yelling just as he reaches the entrance to the forest.</p>

<p>"I made it! Where the plants are big and tall and close together! I knew I would. Nobody will ever find me!"</p>

<p>With that, he tips the hat and swims into the forest. The big fish sees the hat tip, makes an offended gasping sound, and slowly rushes off towards the underwater forest. You watch the big fish swim into the forest and then look down at the small crab.</p>

<p>The crab looks up at you, gives you a shrug, and crab walks away.</p>
