<h1>This is not my Hat</h1>

<p>
The small fish continues talking, cutting you off in the process.</p>

<p>"I stole it from a big fish. He was asleep when I did it."</p>

<p>The small fish says with a big grin on his face. You are looking in the fish's direction, and you happen to see something in the distance behind him.</p>

<p>You squint and see that it's a very massive, very much asleep fish. Who just so happens to wake up as soon as you get a clear look at him.
