<h1>This is not my Hat</h1>

<p>
"About what?"</p>

<p>The little fish inquires, finally giving you a chance to reply.</p>

<p>Well, you say. I think the big fish has woken up, noticed that his hat is gone, and knows it was you who took it. I think you should give it back. Or at least leave it on the ground someplace where you are not.</p>

<p>"No Way!"</p>

<p>The little fish exclaims.</p>

<p>"Even if all that were to happen, there is no way he would know where I am going."</p>

<p>With that, the little fish looks left and right before continuing.</p>

<p>"But, I will tell you where I am going. I am going where the plants grow big and tall and close together. It's very hard to see in there. Nobody will ever find me, and it's right over there!"</p>

<p>The little fish excitedly points his fin to the left. There you see a dense underwater plant forest growing.</p>

<p>"Even if someone besides you knew where I was going, they wouldn't tell."</p>

<p>With that, he gives a hard stare towards your right foot. You look down and see a crab standing beside you. Oh, Hi. Didn't see you there, you say to the crab. The crab looks at you and then back at the little fish. Then the little fish continues his speech.</p>

<p>"I know it's wrong to steal a hat. I know, and it does not belong to me. But I am going to keep it. It was too small for him anyway, and it fits me just right. So, I'm off! Thanks for admiring my hat!"</p>

<p>With that, the little fish starts swimming towards the underwater forest, and the big fish starts swimming towards you.
