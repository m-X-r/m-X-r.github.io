<h1>Hotel Bruce</h1>

<p>The voice continues,</p>

<p>"As Bruce was in no mood for rodents. He turned them out of the house and headed to bed."</p>

<p>You see bruce growl and move his arms in a sweeping motion. He then rushes past the mice into the house, coming back to the door with a broom. Bruce sweeps the mice out and slams the door. Your chair floats into the cottage, and you see Bruce collecting his bags and head towards his bedroom.</p>

<p>He opens his bedroom door and sees a moose, rabbit, porcupine, a couple of turtles, and a raccoon snuggled up in and under his bed in their nightclothes. One of them tells him that this room is full. Another asks him to close the door on his way out. The booming voice returns.</p>

<p>"That started the trouble."</p>
