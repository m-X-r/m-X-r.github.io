<h1>Hotel Bruce</h1>

<p>
Suddenly you hear birds chirping and the sound of wind blowing through the trees. You feel the wind as well, does the wind blow in underwater storytime closets?</p>

<p>You look around and notice you are no longer in scuba gear underwater but instead in a woodland forest. You are sitting in some magic floating leather recliner.</p>

<p>It's the kind of chair you would find at fancy movie theaters, the kind where you can order food off a menu and have it delivered to you. There is a large coke in one armrest cup holder and a large bucket of buttered popcorn in your lap. Suddenly you hear a booming voice in your ears.</p>

<p>"Bruce is back, and this time he has more than goslings on his plate! A host of woodland creatures has taken over his den, and they just won't go away."</p>

<p>Suddenly you see Hotel Bruce, by Ryan T. Higgins, floating in the sky in big bubble letter script.</p>
