<h1>Hotel Bruce</h1>

<p>
The mice hotel owners happen to be in the hall when Bruce started jumping and growling. They rush into a nearby mouse hole in the wall, above which they stuck an Employees Only sign. When the mice come out, two have ties. The third one seems upset it seems as though one of the other two may have stolen his tie. They walk over to Bruce grinning, but the area fills with black smoke before he could complain.</p>

<p>Bruce and the mice run into the kitchen to see what's going on. They approach, and a fox with an apron on runs out, shortly after which a group of turtles follows, chasing the fox with silverware. They go into the kitchen and see a pot boiling over on the stove.</p>

<p>"Looks like turtle soup gone wrong." The booming voice says. "It was a disaster, and Bruce started to lose his cool..."</p>

<p> Before Bruce could start growling, one of his kids walks over. This particular young goose is wearing a bellhop uniform. Bruce looks around and notices that all his kids are in bellhop uniforms. The miniature goose bellhop takes Bruce's hand, and they walk over to the employee's only mouse hole. Bruce's other children are talking to the mice and pointing at Bruce. It looks like the mice understand Bruces' concerns. Then you hear</p>

<p>"...The geese stepped in to smooth things over, and the mice sort of understood." One of the mice goes into the hole and comes out with a large box that he hands to Bruce. Inside is a bear-sized bellhop uniform. In the next moment, you see Bruce and his kids standing in front of the North Woods Hotel posing for a group picture of them in their bellhop uniforms. The mouse owners agreed to take the photo, obviously at the Geese's request. The booming voice returned.</p>

<p>"Just when things couldn't get any worse, they did."</p>

<p>You see the group look into the distance as a tour bus pulls up. The bus stops, and a crowd of elephants, all with cameras, get off. The elephants start stomping everything, franticly taking snapshots, not realizing they were causing lots of property damage.</p>
