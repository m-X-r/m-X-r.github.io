<h1>Hotel Bruce</h1>

<p>
As you get more relaxed, the bubble font disappears, and your chair floats towards a woodland cottage. You slowly drift towards the door and watch it open on its own to let you in.</p>

<p>You sweep over to the fireplace, and there is a picture frame sitting on top. It starts to grow in size right before your eyes. The photo is of a brown bear posing with four young geese on a beach someplace. The bear had on a Hawaiian shirt, and all the geese have floaties on each wing. The booming voice returns.</p>

<p>"Bruce was a bear that lived with four geese, reluctantly, but he was their mom."</p>

<p>The picture got bigger and bigger until you were on the beach, watching the snapshot happen in real-time as lots of beachgoers frolic about the beachside.
