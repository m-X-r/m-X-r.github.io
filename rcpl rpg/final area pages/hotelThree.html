<h1>Hotel Bruce</h1>

<p>
After the photo, you see the four geese tug on Bruce all at once. One pulls his left arm, one his right. One yanks the front of his shirt, and one tugs the back. All wanted their mom's attention, and all wanted to do different things all at the same time. The left-arm tugger pointed towards a sign for the aquarium, the right-arm tugger towards the beach. The front-shirt tugger pointed towards the snack shack and the back-shirt tugger towards the bathroom. Then the voice returned.</p>

<p>"Since Bruce was the geese's mom, he had to migrate south with them every winter, though he would have preferred to hibernate. Migration and motherhood are hard work for a bear. It made Bruce tired and grumpy."</p>

<p>With a deep sigh, Bruce gathered all the geese and stopped at the restroom first. Next was the snack shop, followed by the aquarium, ending at the beach. Burce then carried four sleepy geese off to bed.</p>

<p>The next day Bruce and the geese load their stuff onto a bus. Once they bord, your chair floats out far enough for you to see the bus destination: the Woodland Forest.
