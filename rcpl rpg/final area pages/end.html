<h1> The Woods </h1>

<p>
You walk out the exit door and find yourself on the patio at the Northeast Branch of your local library. Wait, What! you start to say, but then you hear the sound of someone calling out to you.</p>

<p>"Pssst, hey!" they say, and you look over to see someone standing next to the treeline beside the patio.</p>

<p>What! You yell, pointing at your ears. The person says something in reply, but you can't make it out. Still, since you are in a cheerful mood from your storytime experience, you decided to walk closer to try and communicate. By the time you reach the tree line, though, the person you saw has disappeared. But then you hear ocean waves crashing against a beach accompanied by seagull screeches.</p>

<p>It's bizarre to hear authentic beach sounds, considering you are nowhere near a beach and standing next to a wooded area. So weird, in fact, that you want to step into the wooded area to see what's going on. It's not that deep, and it will only take a minute, right?
