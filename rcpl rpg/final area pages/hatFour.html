<h1>This is not my Hat</h1>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>The fish says.</p>

<p>"Asleep! He probably won't wake up for a long time!" He says with glee.</p>

<p>You start to tell him that the fish is, in fact, awoken, but he cuts you off again.</p>

<p>"Even if he does wake up, he probably won't notice that his hat is gone."</p>

<p>At this, you glance back towards the big fish. You see him noticing that his hat is gone. Before you can say anything, the little fish distracts you.</p>

<p>He starts swimming in showy circles in front of your face striking a pose to show off the hat at the tops and bottoms of the shape.</p>
