<h1>This is not my Hat</h1>

<p>
The little fish stops swimming at the top of his latest circle and says,</p>

<p>"even if he does notice that his hat is gone, that fish probably won't know it was me who took it."</p>

<p>With that, he starts making different poses with the hat. You look over at the big fish and see him glaring in yalls direction.
