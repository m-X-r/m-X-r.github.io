<h1>This is not my Hat</h1>

<p>
You are still looking towards the underwater forest when you see the big fish swim out, quickly and slowly at the same time. He was wearing his hat.</p>

<p>He paused and glanced in your direction and then swam away. You feel like he burped.</p>

<p>You float there staring at the forest entrance to see if the little fish would swim out.
