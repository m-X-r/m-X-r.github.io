<h1>Hotel Bruce</h1>

<p>
"The next morning, Bruce woke to the sounds of birds chirping, squirrels chattering, and possums having a pillow fight..." The voice continues.</p>

<p>You see Bruce sitting up in bed with a bird's nest on his head. The baby birds are crying as the Momma bird tries to fill their mouths with worms. Feathers are floating throughout the air. You would think it was from the birds, but two possums had a pillow fight with bruces goose down pillows, a mothers' day gift from his kids. Squirrels were running around his walls like NASCAR drivers.</p>

<p>"...all in his room." the voice booming voice says. "It only got worse from there."</p>

<p>You see Bruce attempting to go thru his morning routine but constantly being interrupted by all hotel guests. In the bathroom, Bruce had a frog in his toilet and a skunk in his shower. In the den, a porcupine was reclining in his chair, drinking coffee out of his mug.</p>

<p>When Bruce walked into the kitchen, a beaver with a seafood bib on was sprinkling his kitchen table with salt before devouring it. Bruce lost it. He started jumping up and down and growling loudly.</p>

<p>"Bruce asked for a manager," the voice said.
