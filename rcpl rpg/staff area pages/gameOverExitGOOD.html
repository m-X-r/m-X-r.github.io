<p>
You walk out the staff exit and find yourself in the staff parking lot. Wow, I didn't know all this was back here, you think, but where is my car? You walk around the building until you are back at the front.</p>

<p>The walk was so long you decided to take a sit-down in your vehicle. You sit for a bit, getting ready to go back inside when you get a little thirsty. Thats when you think a limeade from Sonic would be delicious right now. Sonic isn't too far away. I'll just go real quick, you think to yourself. Then I will come back and finish my library business.</p>

<p>When you get in line at the drive-thru at Sonic, you remember that you cant take cups with straws into the library. Then you get a little hungry. You end up getting the #2 Combo and going home to eat it while watching Netflix. In the end, you never return to the library.
