<h1> Viking Librarian Staff Lockers </h1>

<p>
You choose a door at random and stuff the note inside. The Branch Viking King looks at you somewhat suspiciously. You give him a nervous smile and say, "I think I'll go now. Thanks for your help." "Sure," the Library Giant says, "but first, remind me, does Jessica have on her purple nametag or her yellow nametag today?"</p>

<p> "Oh, I think it was the purple one," you say, trying to walk away.</p>

<p> "Trick Question! All name tags are blue!"</p>

<p> "Impostor!" He yells as he charges at you. </p>
