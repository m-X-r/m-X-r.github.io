<h1> The Kings...Office? </h1>

<p>
You run until you hit a desk of sorts. You fall when you run into it, something falls off the desk and hits you in the head. That thing turns out to be a plaque that says Branch Manager.</p>

<p> Before you can form the thought, Oh Crap! the Branch Manager aka Viking King aka The Boss is standing over you. He demands to know what exactly you are doing roaming around in the Staff Area.</p>

<p> You start studdering, very overwhelmed with your current situation, as well as trying to reason out this Viking library dynamic when you are grabbed by the scruff of your neck and lifted off the ground.</p>

<p> "Why are you back here!" The manager yells.</p>

<p> Terrified, you blurt out... </p>
