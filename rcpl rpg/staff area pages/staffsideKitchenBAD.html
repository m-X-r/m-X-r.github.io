<h1> Kitchen, the Staffside </h1>

<p>
You enter the kitchen stooped low, not sure what to expect. It looks high-tech, modern lighting, fancy restaurant equipment. Based on the castle surroundings you found yourself in, you were expecting a mortar and pestle and a big pot in a fireplace.</p>

<p> You start to stand when you see someone, looks like a librarian! They do not see you, but it seems as though they are trying to lock up a wall that separates the kitchen from the library.</p>

<p> That could be your only escape from these medieval times.  You have to act fast!</p>
