<h1> First Main Hall </h1>

<p>
You have to think for a minute, did I?</p>

<p>The librarian asks again, "So, did you email her?"</p>

<p>Then you remember Yes. I emailed her at the adult computers not too long ago. She told me to talk to the Branch Manager. "Ok, well, in that case, you deserve a pair of promotional blu light blocking glasses!"</p>

<p>What? Suddenly the librarian puts a pair of glasses with thick blue frames with a white library logo on your face. You didn't even have enough time to protest before they were already on your face. The librarian starts babbling about fluorescent blu light and computer blu light and how there is lots of blue light in the staff area, how that blue light is damaging to those who don't work here because staff gets blue light contacts. They just kept going on and on, and you tuned out after the first fluorescent.</p>

<p>"Anyway! The librarian says, suddenly snapping you out of your trance. Go South, and you should run into him." With that, they walk out into the library, leaving you at the door.</p>

<p>You walk into the staff area, traditional office decor. I could have sworn it was a lot darker back here a minute ago. It must have been a trick of the eye; you think as you walk through the door.</p>
