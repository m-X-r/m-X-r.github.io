<h1> the Great Doubt Game </h1>

<p>
You find yourself inside a small room. Flickering florecent lights are above you and nothing is in front of you except a small metal table and a small wooden chair. The walls are tiled with large rectangular white tiles and the floor is concreate gray. You turn back around to the door. Its different now. It's metal, windowless, and locked. You begin to panic when a note slides into the room from the other side of the door.
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="">Read the Note </a></li>
    <li> <a href="">Leave the Note and Hollar for someone to let you out.</a></li>
</ul>
