<h1> Janitors Closet </h1>

<p>
You dash into the door and run into a sink. Good thing it nocks the wind out of you because you hear talking in the hall, beyond the door.</p>

<p> "Did you hear that?" One voice asks</p>

<p> Another answers,"yeah, I heard it too. Perhaps we should check on the Branch Manager. Is he in his office?"</p>

<p> You hear a doorknob, thankfully not yours, jiggle. "Is this door usually locked?" you hear someone say.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p> "Well, let me dance a magic jig? and by that, I mean unlock it... wait, where are my keys?"</p>

<p>" Ha, you are not funny. Let us check on the Manager. He probably has a key."</p>

<p>"You are wrong. I'm hilarious, and the Manager will agree with me."</p>

<p> You hear footsteps walking away from you. That was close, you think, as you crack open the door and peek out. You head out, definitely going in the opposite direction.</p>
