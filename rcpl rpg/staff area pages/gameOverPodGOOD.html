"Sorry, no, but you can email her. Let me get you her card." The librarian starts, but you interrupt.</p>

<p>Conspiracy! You cry. I have been looking everywhere for this alleged Culinary Arts Coordinator! You all thought you could trick me, but I see the Truth!</p>

<p>"Oh, ok, just calm down," the librarian tries, but you refuse to quit.</p>

<p>No! I will not calm down! You are all the Culinary Arts Coordinator! the whole library system consists of Pod People! You are trying to take over! You are trying to spread recipes and literacy across the globe and corner the market! For shame! You yell at the top of your lungs.</p>

<p> You are unsure when the police arrived, but you do remember how the stun gun felt when they shocked you with it.
