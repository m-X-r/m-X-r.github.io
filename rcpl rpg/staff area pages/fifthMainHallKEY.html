<h1> Fifth Main Hall </h1>

<p>You look and see a drive-thru window, with someone sitting next to it on a high chair. There are two librarians in this drive-thru area.</p>

<p>You turn back to see Jessica and the other librarian still looking at you and mumbling amongst themselves. You strongly figure that they are talking about you. Their uneducated perceived opinion hurts. You are NOT crazy!</p>

<p>You stomp on, determined to prove your not crazy case.</p>
