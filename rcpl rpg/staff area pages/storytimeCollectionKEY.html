<h1>The StoryTime Collection</h1>

<p>
You walk over to a shelf full of those dreaded skinny-spined books. What is the deal with these books, you exclaim!</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the librarians is behind you. "These are our StoryTime books. What's a StoryTime?" She continues, "StoryTime is a magical time where all that you can imagine becomes real, and joy abounds!" Oh, ok, you reply, a little startled by her excitement.</p>

<p>"Take some, then go off by yourself and experience the joy of StoryTime." You still don't understand what the deal is, but peer pressure being very real, you rush to get some StoryTime.</p>
