<h1> Third Main Hall </h1>

<p>
The drip you heard is much closer now. You stop to look around, but there is not much to see. Pretty dim, oh wait, what's that.</p>

<p>A speck of bright light appears off in the distance. Is that a way out, you wonder. You step towards the hopeful brightness, and suddenly something is on you.</p>

<p> You scream out in fear then you realize it's just water. Guess that's where the dripping sound was coming from. Suddenly you realize that your cry has attracted some attention. Footsteps and mumbling from the distance are coming your way.</p>

<p>Oh No! Librarian Viking people! You have to go!
