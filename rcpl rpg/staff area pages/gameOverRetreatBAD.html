You decide to stay low and maneuver back to the Storage Room. Oh no! The door to the Storage Room locked behind you when you walked into the kitchen!</p>

<p> You are caught red-handed, wiggling the handle to the storage room door, when the librarian, now finished locking the wall up, heads towards you. As soon they see you, they let out a warning cry, and you hear footsteps rushing towards you from the Main Hall. </p>

<p>In a panic, you start slamming your body into the door, trying to open it when you feel something hit you in the head. You blackout and wake up in some sort of dungeon chained to a stone wall. You stay there for what seems like weeks. All they give you for sustenance is moldy bread and dirty water. How long are they going to keep me here, you think.</p>

<p> Soon you hear the guards talking about an execution coming up. You are the only one you have seen in this dungeon, so they must be talking about you, right.</p>
