You turn to watch the librarian walk away. Well, I was expecting a little more pomp and circumstance.</p>

<p>Hum, you pout, they need to show me the RESPECT I deserve! Don't they know who I am! Your ego trip continues. Well, I bet they will know me when this program does not happen! You huff, and you puff, and you walk out of the library and drive home.</p>

<p>You sit and wait for the library to call and beg for your forgiveness. For whatever reason, they never call.
