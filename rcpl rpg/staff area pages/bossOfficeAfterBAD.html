<h1> Bosses Office </h1>

<p>
You head back towards the Branch Managers Office. He's standing in front of the door. Why would you go this way!</p>

<p> "Oh, did you need something else?" He asks, imposing over you like a Viking King.</p>

<p> "Right." You stammer, "where are the lockers again?" That is the only thing you can think to say.</p>

<p> The Branch Manager just points, giving you an odd look. You turn to head in the direction he mentioned. Then you remember you just put that note in the locker.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, I didn't mean locker. Why would I mean locker! I just put a note in my good friend Jennif, I mean Jessicas locker. Sometimes I call her Jennifer as a kid name. Ha, ha,...Ha, ha. Chair?"</p>

<p>At this point, you are sweating. The Branch Manager moves his arm a bit, still just pointing, looming, and odd-looking over you.</p>
