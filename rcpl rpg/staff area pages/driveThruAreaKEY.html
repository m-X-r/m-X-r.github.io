<h1> Drive-Thru Area </h1>

<p>
You stomp closer to the new librarians. Then you pause to look back at the two by the stairs, very dramatically.</p>

<p>Holding up the key and using your Lord of the Rings voice, you ask the new librarians if they see the key while you hold it up like Simba in the Lion King. The librarians look at you for a whole minute without saying anything. They look at each other, then one looks at you and asks, "So, is this a magic trick? Are you going to pull a key out of thin air now?"</p>

<p>Realizing that apparently, you are the only one who can see this magic key you sidestep. Ha, ha, No! It's a joke! Apparently not a good one, though, ha... You make a 360 turn looking at all the librarians surrounding you. Tough crowd, you say. The drive-thru librarians look at you, smiling politely.</p>

<p>Don't mind me, you tell them. Im just looking around. A customer drives up and distracts one librarian as the other goes back to working on the computer.</p>
