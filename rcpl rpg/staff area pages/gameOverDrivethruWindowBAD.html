<p>
You run straight ahead and see the drive-thru window. Maybe I can make it, you think. You run-up to the window and try to jump out.</p>

<p>Seeing as how you are over five years old, you don't quite fit. Half of you is out the window before you get stuck. That is the exact moment that a car pulls up kind of fast. It hits you, creating a giant mess.</p>

<p>Well, your ghost thinks, at least I won't have to clean that up, sliver lining of Being Dead!</p>
