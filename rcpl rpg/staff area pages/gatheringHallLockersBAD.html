<h1> Viking Librarian Staff Lockers </h1>

<p>
You walk in the direction that the Branch Manager Viking King indicated. There are many cubby-like holes carved into the stone wall, each having a wooden door attached.  Different rune patterns adorn each cubby door. Which one is Jessica's? </p>

<p>You see the Branch Manager King Viking Boss giving you a look. If Jessica were indeed your friend, you would know which one of these lockers is hers. To buy some time you turn back to the Branch Manager, you wouldn't happen to have some paper and a pen would you? "Sure do! Give me one sec." He says, bounding off to gather your materials.</p>

<p> You pull out your phone and google image search the runes quickly. Just as you are putting your phone away the Branch Manager returns with some handmade paper and a quill and ink. You scratch out a quick note and go to put it into your best guess of Jessica's locker.</p>

<p> Which door do you choose?</p>
