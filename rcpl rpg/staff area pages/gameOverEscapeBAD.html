<p>
Right as you start to head off, you see something out the corner of your eye. Then you hear shouting "Hey You!" You turn and see the librarian you saw locking up the wall.</p>

<p> You try to run, but someone grabs you and drags you back into the kitchen, then you black out as something hits you in the head. Next thing you know, you are in some sort of dungeon chained to a stone wall.</p>

<p> You stay there for what seems like weeks. All they give you for sustenance is moldy bread and dirty water. How long are they going to keep me here, you think, and that's when you hear the guards talking about an execution coming up.</p>

<p> You are the only one you have seen in this dungeon, so they must be talking about you. Well, if they are, you think, Ima haunt this place sooooooo hard.</p>
