<p>
You run over and push the librarian down. Before you know it, hands grab you and drag you off them. You feel a blow across the back of your head and everything goes black.</p>

<p> When you awaken, you are in some sort of dungeon chained to a stone wall. You stay there for what seems like weeks. All they give you for sustenance is moldy bread and dirty water. How long are they going to keep me here, you think.</p>

<p> One day you hear the guards talking about an execution coming up. You are the only one you have seen in this dungeon, so they must be talking about you. This is what I get for reading!  You yell right before you sink into a pile on the floor against the wall and sulk.</p>
