<h1> Kitchen, the Staffside </h1>

<p>
You look around and see a light switch. Then a crazy idea pops into your head.</p>

<p> Figuring you would risk it, you start flashing the lights and making low moaning sounds. The librarian looks up at the lights, lets out a loud "NOPE," and walks out the kitchen via the wall they were trying to lock up.</p>

<p> Not wanting to go the same way they did, you try the door to the store-room. You discover that it locked behind you.</p>

<p>You walk over to the open wall and peek out to see if you see anyone before you head out.</p>
