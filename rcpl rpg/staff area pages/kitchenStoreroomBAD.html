<h1> Kitchen Store Room </h1>

<p>
You rush through the door to the West of you. The room you enter is full of containers.</p>

<p> Some have beans and flour in them. You see preserved jellies and jams, loaves of bread and vegetables, and preserved meats. In the torchlight, you even see a round of cheese. </p>

<p>Outside the room, in the hall, you hear a conversation among multiple people. You just missed them. Can't go back out that way, now what?</p>
