<h1> A Comfy Chair </h1>

<p>
You stumble upon a comfy chair and sit down. There is a random bin in front of the chair. At first, you didn't know why anyone would just leave an empty container on the floor. Then you realize how convenient it is to prop your feet upon it.</p>

<p>You had just gotten good and comfortable when someone walks into the room. It's the security guard. The security guard stares at you and asks who you are and why you are in the staff area. You reply that you talked to the Branch Guy and that you were looking for the Coordinator of Stuff.</p>

<p>"Looks like you are sitting with your feet propped up to me. Since the Stuff Coordinator is not in here, maybe, you should look someplace else. Someplace that is not in the staff area. They also mentioned that It's your lucky day and that they will even escort you." </p>
