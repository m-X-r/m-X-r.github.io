<h1> Drive-Thru Area </h1>

<p>
You grab up your StoryTime Experience, promising the librarian that you will find a spot to have your experience. "Good choice!" she says, smiling at you.</p>

<p>I got a little turned around back here. How do I get back out to where the front desk is? "You can go thru this door here." She says, pointing to a door.</p>

<p>Weird, you think. Has that door been there the whole time I was back here? Funny, I don't remember seeing it. You step out the door, and as it closes behind you, a thought hits you.</p>

<p>Isn't there a storytime room here? Didn't I pass it earlier in my self-guided tour of the branch? I should go back there. I'm bound to find the perfect spot for this experience there.</p>
