You walk over to the drive-thru window seeing that the librarian previously sitting there has walked over to a bookshelf. Now is your chance to play librarian.</p>

<p>You start talking to the customer waiting in the drive-thru. You start chatting them up about the weather, as well as local sales at grocery stores.</p>

<p>This, of course, gets you banned from the library. Still, totally worth it.
