You have yet to find the Culinary Arts Coordinator and have gotten frustrated. Suddenly you start to scream.</p>

<p> I'm over this!</p>

<p>I can-can solo!</p>

<p>I can even can with my newfound club mates!</p>

<p>Everyone is not worthy of the fine art of Canning!</p>

<p>"Right," Jessica says while the other librarian just looks at you. You had forgotten about them.</p>

<p> Embarrassed, you say, so, I think I will be leaving now. Rushing back towards the Staff Exit Door. You leave the library and never return due to embarrassment.
