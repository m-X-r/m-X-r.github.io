<p>
"Uhm, can I help you?" The unfunny key-losing librarian asks.</p>

<p> You reply, no, seeing as how pitifully unfunny you are. I mean, look at my eyes, not even remotely moist from laughter tears, you say, pulling your blu light blocking glasses up. As soon as you pull your glasses up, everything changed.</p>

<p>Suddenly everything looked like an old castle, with stone walls and actual torches. The librarians were now business casual Viking people. They had swords at their hips and shields on their backs. They even had the hats with the horns! You start to apologize, but before you know it, they are grabbing you.</p>

<p> Next thing you know, you are in some sort of dungeon chained to a stone wall. You stay there for what seems like weeks. All they give you for sustenance is moldy bread and dirty water. How long are they going to keep me here, you think, and that's when you hear the guards talking about an execution coming up.</p>

<p>You are the only one you have seen in this dungeon, so they must be talking about you, right. I should have just laughed and let it go, you think, that's my only regret in life.
