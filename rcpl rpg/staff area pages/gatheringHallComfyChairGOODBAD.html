<h1> A Comfy Chair </h1>

<p>
You shuffle over to the comfy chair and sit down. You are sweating and shakey and in a general state of hot mess-ness.</p>

<p>As you plop down into the chair you take a deep exhale. In the middle of it, you see the Master of Big and Scary walking your way. By the time he gets over to the comfy chair, you have just about passed out. Seeing as how you started holding your breath as soon as you saw him coming.</p>

<p> He looks down on you in the chair, and then he reaches his hand out towards you. You squeeze your eyes closed, waiting for impact when you feel something small and softish plop into your lap.</p>

<p> You wait a minute, and then you peek down. There is a Snickers in your lap!</p>

<p> You look up at the Branch Manager. </p>

<p>"We are not supposed to be giving customers food, but you look kinda rough. Maybe this will raise your blood sugar, as well as your spirits." He says, smiling at you. </p>

<p>"It definitely will, thanks!" you reply, smiling back. </p>
