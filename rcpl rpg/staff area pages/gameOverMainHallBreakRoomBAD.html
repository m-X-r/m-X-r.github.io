<p>
You end up running into a mini kitchen, A modern mini kitchen that's a microwave! Do they have electrical outlets in this castle? Before you could ponder any more, you feel some hands grabbing you from behind.</p>

<p>Next thing you know, you are in some sort of dungeon chained to a stone wall. You stay there for what seems like weeks.</p>

<p>All they give you for sustenance is moldy bread and dirty water. How long are they going to keep me here, you think, and that's when you hear the guards talking about an execution coming up.</p>

<p>You are the only one you have seen in this dungeon, so they must be talking about you, right?
