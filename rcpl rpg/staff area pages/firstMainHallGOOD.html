<h1> First Main Hall </h1>

<p>
You use the gift from Melanie, and the door buzzes open. Before you can grab the handle, someone coming out opens the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, hi!" a librarian says with a smile but also a little alarmed. "Did you need some help?"</p>

<p>Yes, Melanie gave me this, you say, holding up the fob. She said I needed to set up a program. She also told me to email her, and now I'm here.</p>

<p>"Right..." the librarian says, looking at you and the gift from Melanie and then back at you. "So, did you email her like she asked?"</p>
