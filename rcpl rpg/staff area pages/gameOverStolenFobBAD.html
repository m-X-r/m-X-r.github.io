<p>
The Branch Manager looks down on you with a stern yet puzzled face, and he starts asking you some questions.</p>

<p>  "So you knowingly stole library property?" he asks.</p>

<p>  Yeah, sorry about that, you say.</p>

<p> "You then used that stolen property to break into an unauthorized area to look around essentially?" The Viking King asked next.</p>

<p> I see how bad this looks, but it's an honest mistake, you plead. The Big Boss Man continues. </p>

<p>"And now that you are caught, you somehow think admitting to all these infractions like it's no big deal will help you in your current situation?"</p>

<p> Yes! Absolutely!... Wait!</p>

<p> Before you can finish, The Viking King informs you that you are Banned. Suddenly you hear a chorus of people chanting Banned! Banned! Banned!  You are grabbed up, and a sack is put over your head. Next thing you know, you are in some sort of dungeon chained to a stone wall. You stay there for what seems like weeks.</p>

<p> All they give you for sustenance is moldy bread and dirty water. How long are they going to keep me here, you start to think. Before you can finish your thought, you are dragged out of your cell and taken to the executioner's block.</p>

<p> The last thing you hear is chanting. Banned! Banned! Banned!</p>
