<p>
You give up on fiddling with the door and make peace with the fact that the kitchen will be your new home. You look in the fridge and expect to see lots of food, but there is only a little. You try and go back to the storeroom but find that it is locked.</p>

<p> You ration out the little bit of food in the fridge for what feels like weeks. You are soooo hungry you think you might die, suddenly someone walks in. You think it's that librarian you saw locking the wall so long ago.</p>

<p> They look at you. "The Hell!" They exclaim. Please! You say I will do anything if you feed me! You see them ponder what you have proposed.</p>

<p> "You will be my kitchen serf forever, and your name will now be serf."  Deal! You shout, rushing over to kiss their shoes. And that's how your life living under the stove in the kitchen at Northeast started.</p>
