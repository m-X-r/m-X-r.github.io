"Oh, is she here?" The librarian with the lost keys asked. Being questioned, along with your general nervousness of being in the staff area, push you over the edge.</p>

<p> For whatever reason, you kind of feel like you are robbing a bank, and you just got caught. You'll never catch me alive! You yell and suddenly burst into a sprint, looking for the nearest exit.</p>

<p>Instead, you end up running into a wall, caught up looking behind you to see if the librarians were chasing you. In the end, the librarians did not give chase. They were just trying to figure out what was happening and witnessed a presumed suicide attempt.
