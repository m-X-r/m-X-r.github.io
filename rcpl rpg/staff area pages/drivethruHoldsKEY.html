<h1> Drive-Thru Holds </h1>

<p>
You walk towards a shelf of books in the drive-thru area. You see little slips of paper in all the books. It feels like you've seen this before.</p>

<p>The librarian that was at the window walks over to the shelf. "Excuse me." They say, looking through some of the slips. Suddenly they grab a book and walk back to the window. Then you remember where you have seen this before.</p>

<p>They have a shelf like this up by the front desk. This one is much cooler though, here, if you put something on hold, you can get it without ever having to leave your car!</p>
