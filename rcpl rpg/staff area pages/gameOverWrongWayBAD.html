<p>
Not thinking clearly and in a panic, you head back out towards the First Hall in an attempt to flee.</p>

<p> "Where are you going? Aren't you going to leave a note for your friend?!" The Branch Manager Viking King Exclaims. You break out into a run.</p>

<p> You quickly learn that besides being formidable and robust, Viking King Branch Managers are also really good at throwing things. You are not sure what it was but as you started to run the Manager threw something at your head, a book maybe. It knocked you out, and you woke up in some sort of dungeon chained to a stone wall.</p>

<p> You stay there for what seems like weeks. All they give you for sustenance is moldy bread and dirty water. How long are they going to keep me here, you think, and that's when you hear the guards talking about an execution coming up. Who is getting executed? You ask them.</p>

<p> "You are!" they reply. </p>
