<p>
You make a right in an attempt to escape the Librarian Viking chasing you. You run directly into a shelf of children's books, and it falls on you. It was the Storytime collection; those are books librarians read to children at Storytime.</p>

<p> A storytime would have been lovely to experience. Maybe you should check the afterworld library to see if they have storytimes as well, because, You Are Dead!</p>
