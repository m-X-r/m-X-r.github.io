<h1> Branch Managers Office </h1>

<p>
As you walk into the office, the Branch Manager motions for you to sit down as he rounds his desk and sits down behind it. "Now, why did Meline send you?" He asks.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, you have gotten nervous and just spit out Canning! "Canning?" The Branch Manager repeats, obviously confused. You take a deep breath and tell him about the flyer, Canning club, the event, your interaction with Meline, and the email. You say it all as one long sentence.</p>

<p>"I see,"  he says when you finish."Well, it seems to me that you need to talk to our Culinary Arts Coordinator. We can go..." Before he can finish, his phone rings. He answers it then cups the mouthpiece. "I'm sorry," he whispers. "This is kinda important. If you go back out and take two lefts, she should be in the kitchen."</p>

<p>With that, he waves you out of his office. "Wait," he whispers with urgency before you can leave. "Can you shut the door behind you? Thanks."</p>

<p>You gently shut his door behind you.</p>
