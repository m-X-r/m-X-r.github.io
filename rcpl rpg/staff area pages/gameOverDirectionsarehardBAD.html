<p>
You head East and end up back in the First Hall. You see all the people you heard talking from the Store Room, and they see you. They grab you and knock you out. Next thing you know, you are in some sort of dungeon chained to a stone wall.</p>

<p> You stay there for what seems like weeks. All they give you for sustenance is moldy bread and dirty water. How long are they going to keep me here, you say to yourself one day.</p>

<p> One of the guards walks over to your cell. "Don't worry," he says. "We won't be keeping you much longer. I hear they will be executing you soon." Oh, thanks, you say sarcastically to the guard. "Oh yeah," the guard says before walking away. "This is for you." He tosses a compass at you and laughs as he walks away.</p>
