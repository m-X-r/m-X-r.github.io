<h1> Fifth Main Hall </h1>

<p>You are creeping along, on your tippy-toes, like a cartoon character peeking behind you. Perhaps you should have been peaking in front because you run directly into a Library Viking.</p>

<p> In the torchlight, you see them in business casual clothing. But also with a giant shield strapped to their back and horned helmet of some kind.</p>

<p> They had a computer printout in their hand and were not looking where they were going either. So they are just a startled by the collision as you are.</p>

<p> That gives you just enough time to run away.</p>
