<h1> Fifth Main Hall </h1>

<p>
You walk into what seems to be a drive-thru area. Well, at least there is a drive-thru window.</p>

<p>There are two librarians in this new area, one at the window and one at a computer by the window. The librarian manning the drive-thru window speaks to you. "Did you need something?" They ask.</p>

<p>Yes, you say, I was looking for the Culinary Arts Coordinator, have you seen her? Both the librarians say, No. Then they both suggest that you email her to set up a time to meet. That seems to be the consensus, you say.</p>

<p>"Well," the one at the computers says, "you are welcome to use our public computers to email her. You can head out this door." Suddenly there is a door next to you that you didn't notice when you walked back.</p>

<p>Was that door always there, you ponder as the librarian gently pushes you out of it.
