"You lie!" Bellows the Branch Manager, "No one named Salley even works here! Unless, of course, you are referring to Salley, SC." </p>

<p>Yes, Yes, you stammer Salley SC!</p>

<p> "You mean the one formerly known as John Town?</p>

<p>Settled by land grants from King George II of England?</p>

<p> Burned by Sherman during the Civil War?</p>

<p> Incorporated by SC Legislature Dempsey Salley around 1887?</p>

<p>That Salley?" The Branch Manager Viking King guy Inquired.</p>

<p> Yes, Yes, Yes, that very one! You reply. "That is nowhere near here!" The Branch Manager enlightens you, slinging you out of his office.</p>

<p>As you fly towards Salley, you guess you hit something hard and blackout from the pain. Next thing you know, you are in some sort of dungeon chained to a stone wall. You stay there for what seems like weeks. All they give you for sustenance is moldy bread and dirty water. How long are they going to keep me here, you think, and that's when you hear two guards talking about an execution coming up.</p>

<p> One says this one is going to be unique. That everyone is going to get to come. They say they are going to set up the execution someplace called Sally SC. The other one asks, you mean the one formerly known as Johns Town?</p>
