<h1> Third Main Hall </h1>

<p>
Following along what seems to be the same part of the hallway that you have been in forever, you suddenly hear some giggling ahead.</p>

<p>Seconds later, you smell something yummy. Unfortunately, the sounds and smells don't seem to be coming from the same direction.</p>

<p>One appears to be coming from the East and the other from the South.</p>
