<h1>Office Space </h1>

<p>
You walk into a large room with tables in the middle. The way the tables are arranged, it seems as if they serve as wall-less offices. Just not nearly as fancy as you would find at a tech firm.</p>

<p> You are looking at an exciting nicknack on someone's desk when a hand grabs your shoulder. You turn quickly to see a man smiling at you. "Can I help You?" He asks.</p>

<p>You look at his name tag. It says Branch Manager. Melanie sent me! You quickly say, as if you are confessing to a crime. "Really? Come have a seat in my office." He says, guiding you in the direction of his office.</p>
