<p>
As you turn to walk off, the other librarian stops you.</p>

<p>"What do you think you're doing pal, I saw that!" Saw what you reply? "Saw you slip that key in your pocket!"</p>

<p>She found her key, and this one is mine now! You try and runoff, but Jessica tackles you, and the key is retrieved. The librarians take a mug shot of you and inform you that you are banned. Forever.
