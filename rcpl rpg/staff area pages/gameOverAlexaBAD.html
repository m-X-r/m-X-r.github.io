"Crossword puzzles?!" The Branch Manager bellows, "You mean the ones in the backs of the Newspapers?"</p>

<p> YYYeeesssss? You stammer.</p>

<p> "I see. You are  that Alexa device newspaper patron, aren't you?" </p>

<p>Remembering what you pulled at the Tech Help Desk, you panicked. It was a joke! You squeak out.</p>

<p> "Not a very good one." The Branch Manager replies, dropping you to the ground. Your head hits the corner of his desk, and you blackout.</p>

<p> When you come to, you are in some sort of dungeon chained to a stone wall. You stay there for what seems like weeks. All they give you for sustenance is moldy bread and dirty water. </p>

<p>How long are they going to keep me here? You yell out loud. "I don't know," one of your dungeon guards replies. "Why don't you ask Alexa, ha ha ha ha." It was a joke, you whimper. "Was it, though?" is the only reply you get. </p>
