<h1> Staff Breakroom </h1>

<p>
You walk into what seems to be a min-staff kitchen. Someone heating a packed lunch in the microwave is what is smelling so good.</p>

<p>What is that? It smells great. You ask, startling the librarian warming up lunch. She ends up telling you all about the recipe. It's a family recipe from Spain, and her grandma used to make it for her every week. She even lets you try some, and it is delicious.</p>

<p>Just then, you remember, canning, and you ask if she has seen the Culinary Arts Coordinator. "I think I saw her earlier, she says with a mild Spanish accent, but not lately."
