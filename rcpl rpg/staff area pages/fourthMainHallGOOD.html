<h1> Fourth Main Hall </h1>

<p>
You walk upon two librarians talking and laughing.</p>

<p> Right, when you walk up, one is saying, "how about I dance a little jig, and by that, I mean Ima unlock the door. Wait, where are my keys?"</p>

<p>"Wow, you are sooooo funny," the second one replies. Then they see you and both stop and give you the who is this look.</p>

<p>Then the one who didn't lose their keys speaks up. "Hi, did you need some help?"</p>
