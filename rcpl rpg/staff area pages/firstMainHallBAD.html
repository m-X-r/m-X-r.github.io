<h1> First Main Hall </h1>

<p>
Everything is different in the staff area. You are no longer sure if you are at a library or in a live-action version of that show with the Games and the Thrones and the Dragons.</p>

<p> When you walked through the door, you passed through some thin barrier, kind of like a force field. Everything looked like typical office space before you passed through, but once you were inside, everything looked like an old castle: stone walls and actual torches.</p>

<p> Before you can wrap your mind around it, you hear someone coming. Better hide. </p>
