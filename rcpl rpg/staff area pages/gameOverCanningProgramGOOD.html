You talk some more, and a plan formulates. Over the next few weeks, you coordinate with the canning club and the Culinary Arts Coordinator. A month later, you have a canning extravaganza at the Northeast Branch.</p>

<p>All sorts of things end up canned at the celebration, fruits, veggies, fish, and even beef! You even got just about everything donated for the event, and no one had to pay for anything.</p>

<p>Everyone had a great time, and you go down in canning history as one of the greats.</p>
