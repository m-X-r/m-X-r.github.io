<p>You reach the door and run out before whoever was behind you can catch you.</p>

<p>The problem is you run dead into a Library Viking person coming inside. They shove you back inside while saying something to the people who were chasing you. Everything went black after that.</p>

<p>Next thing you know, you are in some sort of dungeon chained to a stone wall. You stay there for what seems like weeks. All they give you for sustenance is moldy bread and dirty water. How long are they going to keep me here, you think, and that's when you hear the guards talking about an execution coming up. That's also when the dirty water and the bread stop showing up.</p>

<p>After a while, you wonder if they are going to execute you or starve you to death. Or maybe execution means starving to death. Either way, you pass out before you find out, never to awaken again.</p>
