<h1>How to make a Text based RPG game, with HTML. Part 2</h1>

<p>
So at this point you should have a full fledged HTML RPG game about the three little pigs. You have worked hard at crafting all the pages that make up your map, you have linked all those pages together, you added dialoge option. You have done a lot of hard work! Good Job!
</p>

<p>
As proud as you are of your new game, looks a little plain, right? Well have no fear, in part two of How to make a text based RPG game with HTML, we are going to jazz things up a little bit. 
</p>

<h1><a href="../test/momPigsHouse.html" target="_blank">This is what I did to jazz my pages up!</a></h1>

<ol>
<li>I changed background and text colors</li>
<li>I created a gify animation and inserted it as an iframe</li>
<li>I used images for my compass links</li>
<li>I centered all the elements on my page (and I made my body padding a little bigger)</li>
</ol>


<p>In this part two, I am going to walk you through how I jazzed my web page up so you can jazz your's up as well. Before you freak out, you dont have to make the same design decisions as me, because I know pink isn't for everyone, ha,ha. So get ready, because here we go! </p>
