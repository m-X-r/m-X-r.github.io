<p id="question" >I initially started writing this in order to create a templet for my pi club on how they could use childrens books to help them come up with a storyline to create a  room based HTML game. I started it before Covid hit, like 2019 and didn't finish until 2022 I was planning on creating a map based game to go along with this story, but for now just the finishing of the rewriting process is good enough for me. 9.2.22 </p>
