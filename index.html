<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>
"I am Ms. Jessica aka Repooc_todj. I started coding by happen stance one day, after I swore off everything IT."</p>

<p> "I joined a coding club at my <a href="https://www.richlandlibrary.com/locations/northeast" target="_blank">local library</a> and as an activity we created a text-based RPG game using python. I didn't like the way my game came out very much, I'm not great at python and I could't make it do all I wanted. So currently I am remakeing it using HTML."</p>

<p> "One day I hope to turn it and other HTML games Im working on into real games useing Unity. That day, sadly is not today. In the meantime I will keep learning and keep posting links. You can see what I got going so far below."</p>

<p>"I think yall should definatley drop by my <a href="https://rcplne.github.io/" target="_blank">coding club</a> sometime and say hello :)"</p>
</div>


<br><br><br>
<div id="moon">
<h2 style="text-align:center;">The Moon</h2>

<p>
While I was learning to code I zero-ed in on HTML. Mostly because I could do it on any computer (I work on a lot of shared computers). I didn't have to download any code readers and I could see my results immediatly. One day I was at my <a href="https://www.richlandlibrary.com/locations/northeast" target="_blank">local library</a> and I saw a childrens book on display.</p>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41887684-how-to-be-on-the-moon" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;">
<h1>How to be on the Moon <span style="font-size:15px;">Vivian Schwarz</span></h1>
</a>
<img src="pic/howtobeOntheMoon.jpg" alt="how2beontheMoon" height="" width="">

<p>I thought it was a cute story,so I decided to try and make it into a game with HTML. Before I did though I wanted to know what other books Vivian had written and I found one with the same main character. Its called How to find Gold. It was also cute, so I wanted to add it into my game idea as well.</p>

<p>The thought process I have now has the game starting off with an online dating app. You try to find your dates house and get lost. The only person you find to help you says you have to help her take a trip to the moon before she helps you. And of course you cannot get to the moon without finding gold first. So if you want to go on that date (you really, really do) you have to find gold and get to the moon first. Better not be late!</p>

<p>Sadly, I haven't finished the game yet. When I do finish it I will put a link to it <a href="" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
</div>

<div id="pigs">
<h2 style="text-align:right;">Pigs</h2>
<p>When I started making HTML games I thought it would be fun to invite my friends to make some too. I quickly realized trying to explain the whole process in person was hard if you were trying to explain it to multiple people at once. Also, Corona happen. So I decided to make some <a href="revamp instructions pt 1/b.threelittlepigsInstructionsRevamp.html" target="_blank">HTML pages</a> to explain the process. I got as far as someone making a game with no CSS. So it works, but it looks boring.</p>

<p>Since I started using childrens books as inspiration, my directions are based on the three little pigs. They walk you through making a game based off the story of the three little pigs. Sounds sus, but I thought it was cool. If you try out my instructions and make a game you should totally <a href="mailto:jdotcoopers@gmail.com?subject=three little pigs rpg from a stranger">email it</a> to  me!</p>

<div id="quotes">
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Quotes</h2>
<p>Bing was my homepage for a really long time. I really love all the pictures. I love (some of the) quotes that you see when you click on the pictures even more. Like some people over time I had written down a lot of quotes I found and liked. I decided that it was high time that I <a href="quote/quoteGrid.html" target="_blank"> put them all in one place</a></p>
<p>Im sure I have more somewhere, but I haven't run across them yet. With me on this HTML game kick I had to add a twist. If you click on a hyperlinked quote It will take you to a game I made to go with it!</p>
</div>


<br><br><br>
<div id="monster">
<h2 style="text-align:left;">Monsters</h2>
<p>So I like monsters I guess. I draw them and make cologes of them, sometimes I even make paper toys of them. I'm not the best draw-er, so sometimes they look kinda boxy (expecially if I make a paper toy of them).</p>

<p>Because of their sometimes boxy deminor, some people (not you of course) confuse them with robots. I dont like that, they dont like it either, but there is nothing I can do about it. What I could do is make people more aware of monsters. They just dont get their due in my opinion. You are scarred of the monster in your closet or under your bed when you are small. But by the time you grow up you have forgotten about them. They grew up too you know. You should check in on them. To help <a href="https://repooc-todj.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">I started a Blog about monsters</a> and their comings and goings. Like a newsletter full of employee of the months, but instead its monsters.</p>
