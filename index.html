<div class="grid-item"><p>For Pi Club.</p>
<p id="question" >I initially started writing this in order to create a templet for my pi club on how they could use childrens books to help them come up with a storyline to create a  room based HTML game. I started it before Covid hit, like 2019 and didn't finish until 2022 I was planning on creating a map based game to go along with this story, but for now just the finishing of the rewriting process is good enough for me. <br>9.2.22 </p>
<p>Now I want more, an interactive installation with a web element like a digital turn by turn map walking tour with cardboard props <br>1.30.23<p/>

<div class="grid-item"><p>For Jake</p>
<p id="question" >I started this experience to just walk people around my branch. Then it evolved, then I casted my coworkers, then I let Jake playtest it. He was super excited about it. Then It grew, and now I have no idea whats going on and its unfinished. But I really want to finish it so Jake can play it again. <br>1.31.23</p>
