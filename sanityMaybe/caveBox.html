  You find yourself in the dark. You take a step and feel the rocky cave bottom under your shoes. Its cold and you 
  feel a slight breeze. You walk and run into a cold wall so you turn and start walking the other way. As you walk 
  your eyes start to adjust and the dark turns into a gray tone. Then you see them. A figure standing in front of you.
