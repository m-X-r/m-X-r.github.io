You make your way down the road you just came from. You walk for a while, the sun comes up.<br><br>
    
You walk and walk and walk but never see the tree again. In fact, even though you are sure you turned around you swear you have passed the same rock at least four times. <br><br> 
    
You turn back the original way (you think) you were heading, the sun goes back down. Suddenly you hear someone whistle at you. You look up and see the crossroad with that guy in a top hat still sitting on a fence post. <br><br>
    
He smiles, < a href="crossRoads.html"> "looking for me?" </a>
<!--ABSOLUTLY NOT! (but in the sake of moving on ok i guess (in the context of this story! dont come for me bro!) -->
