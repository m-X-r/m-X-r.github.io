It was ackward at first, and kinda slimy.
Then, you got into it.
You never realized how flexible you were, and how much more flexible you wish you were until now.
This is the most amazing experiece you ever had. 
You beg for more, and your requests are granted.
</p>
<p>
Eventually every involved party is spent.
All the resources are used up.
Daddy turns to leave.
You beg Daddy to stay as you fall asleep.
</p>
<p>
You wake up alone, the river empty.
Your unease was replaced by pleasure, your pleasure replaced by longing.
