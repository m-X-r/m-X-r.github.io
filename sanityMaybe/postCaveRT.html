 <!--cave bear from behind what is it : img...pivot: text so dont have to keep drawing bears for this.. -->
 <p>
  You come back to a table still set for tea. The <a 
  herf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank">Ursus arctos</a> with a top hat and a bow 
  tie on. is sitting at the table knitting. When the Ursus sees you and starts gathering the knitting you hear that soothing voice again. 
  Oh dear, Im so glad you are back with the milk and sugar. The Ursus gathers the items from you and rushes off. Soon the Ursus is back 
  with the beautiful steaming teapot with matching sugar and milk bowls. 
 </p>
 <p>
  The Ursus gets ready to sit then it stops. My frend should be here for tea, such a wonderful conversationalist.  Would you <a href="cave.html">be a dear and get them</a> for me?
