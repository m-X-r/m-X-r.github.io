You make your way down the path, then down the road. You walk for a while feeling some kind of way.<br><br>
    
You dont like the way that weird neck smoking suspender guy talked to you. You start thinking up the perfect comeback. <br><br>
    
You settle on a good one and turn around to walk back. You walk and walk and walk but never see the tree again. In fact, even though you are sure you turned around you swear you have passed the same rock at least four times. <br><br> 
    
You turn back the original way (you think) you were heading when you hear someone whistle at you. You look up and see a crossroad and a guy in a top hat sitting on a fence post. <br><br>
    
He smiles, < a href="crossRoads.html"> "looking for me?" </a>
