 <!--cave bear from behind what is it : img...pivot: text so dont have to keep drawing bears for this.. -->
 <p>
 
  You come across a table set for tea. You hear a rustling behind you and encounter an <a 
  herf="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"> Ursus arctos </a> wearing a 
  black bankers top hat with a blue and pink poke-a-dot bow tie.
  
  You would run but you are distracted by the steam wofting from the spout of a beautiful floral patterned teapot that the Ursus is caressing. Suddenly you hear a soothing voice in your head. It's kind and warm when it says, Hi dear. I would invite you to tea but I forgot my milk and sugar. I put them in a box in the cold dark part of the cave. Would you <a href="cave.html">be a dear and get them</a> for me?
