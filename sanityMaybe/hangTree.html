 <p>
you awake in the dark. Your neck hurts something awful. What happen...? <br><br>
"They got you whats happened." <br><br>
A match strikes a matchbox in the dark and you watch a flame light the end of a cigarette.
 </p>
  <p>
    As your eyes adjust to the light you see a man sitting on a box beside a tree. He has on a white longs sleeve shirt and trousers with suspenders. There is something else about him but you cant tell what it is, just that its off. <br><br>
    You realize you are on the ground lying in short grass. You get up slowly and dust yourself off. As you do the moon comes from behind some clouds and you get a good look around. You are in a medow with a large tree in the middle. The one the man on the box smoking is sitting beside.
  </p>
  <p>
    Who got me? you ask the man <br><br>
    "Dem K cubed boys, who else."<br><br>
    Suddenly you remember. The chase. The box. The snap....
  </p>
  <p>
    You also realize whats wrong with the smoking man. His neck. Its, broken. Severly broken! Like how is his smoking talking to you right now and not dead broken.<br><br>
    "They got me too."<br><br>
    Are we dead? you ask the smoking man. He takes a big drag off his cigarette.<br><br>
    "Why dwell on all that. Instead consider this, what you are is here next to me. What I am is prefering to be alone to smoke in peace. So that means you need to be getting along your way and away from mines."
  </p>
  <p>
    But, were am I supposed to go?<br><br>
    "Look, I dont begin to presume I know your business, nor do I want to. My guess is you here for <a href="hangTree2.html" style="font-size: 20px; "> DeWite DeVil </a>."<br><br>
    Who is DeWite DeVil? Why would I...<br><br>
    "DeWite DeVil is nowhere round here, so how bout you go own down the road there and look in town."<br><br>
    You turn and see a path to a road lit up by the moonlight. You turn around to say something to the smoking man, but hes gone and you are all alone.
