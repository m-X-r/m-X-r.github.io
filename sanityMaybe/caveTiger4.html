"I love tea. I love." <br>
You interrupt the tiger and inform it that dad...the frog is gone.<br>
"Gone, really! How ever did you get it to leave? Wait no, we will talk about it over tea I will <a href="cavePostRiver2.html">meet you there.</a> I need to freshen up first."<br>
The tiger slinks off deeper into the cave.
