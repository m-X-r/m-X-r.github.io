<h1> Cafe Area Canning Shop Talk </h1>

<p> You sit down at a large round table. You kind of feel like King Author at his court. Someone else sits down as well and you notice that they have a book about canning and food preservation. OMG, you are exactly like King Author now, because you are a Canning Expert! So much so that you were actually canning before you came to the library. Which is exactly what you say to this new member of your canning court. You find out that Dan here is trying to culminate a canning club and already has a few potential members. Only problem is they are all new just like him. Dan goes on to insist that the club could really use a Canning Expert like yourself. He invites you to his mom’s house for the first meeting. </p> 

<p> Doesn’t the library have meeting rooms? You start to wonder if Dan’s Moms house is worth of a Canning King… </p>
