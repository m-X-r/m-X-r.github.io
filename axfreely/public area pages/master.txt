keyOne *fictionstacksNE
keyTWO *fictionstacksNE---hightablesittingsuggestion (keyThree)
keyThree hightablesittingsuggestion---*cookingClassButter ---cookingClassTake (keyThree1-46)
keyThree1-46 cookingClassTake (to pt 2)

before pt two you have 1q84 book, gold high table coin, and carolines library fob.

*book will help you...
*fob will help you...
*coin will help you beat something in the temple in pt3 (of3).
