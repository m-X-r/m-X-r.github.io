<h1>The Tapas Room </h1>

<p> You see a door. It has a large glass panel in it, and you can see a mini office space inside. You try the door, but the handle won't even jiggle. You try to shake it harder, no change, except that now the whole door is making a shaking sound. Next thing you know, a librarian is behind you. "Did you need help with something?" The librarian that has approached you is a young lady. She has on some gray dress pants and a purple sweater. Her tone is friendly but firm. You let her know that you were looking around and saw this office area and wanted a closer look. "Sorry, this is a staff area, so it's not available for customers, but feel free to look through the glass if you like." With that, she smiles and walks back to the front desk. You peek inside and then decide to move on. </p>
