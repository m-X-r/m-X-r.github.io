<h1>  Compact Disks </h1>

<p>You wonder if there are people who still use Cd players. Not in general but specifically in their cars with the tape deck to cd player converter. Before you complete your thought, someone comes by and collects a very large stack of pop CDs.</p>

<p>As they walk away you hear mumbling about burning cdâ€™s. At first you thought they meant in a fire, then you remembered how you used to burn mixtapes for your friends in High School. You start pondering making mix usb drives for your friends as you walk away.</p>
