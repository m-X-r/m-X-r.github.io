<h1> Print-poluza </h1>

<p> You sit down and think, what can I printâ€¦.. </p>

<p> Sixty minutes later you have found multiple of pictures of bears with top hats. A few of the bears also have colorful bowties. Your favorite bear of the bunch has a top hat, bow tie, and a monocle! As you send each bear pic to print you see a little box pop up on your screen that says your job has been sent to the printer. After sending your Monocle bear to the printer you take a moment to be proud for all that you have accomplished. </p>
