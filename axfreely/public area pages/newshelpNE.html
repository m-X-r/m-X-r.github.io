<h1> The Help Desk </h1>

<p> The librarian looks at you, then she turns to looks behind her, obviously confused. Her nametag very clearly reads Jessica in big bold letters. You decide that you have come to far to turn back now. You look her right in the eye and repeat; Alexa, what’s in the news! This time you say rather forcefully, pausing in between each word. The librarian looks at you, "I'm sorry, what's happening right now?" as she speaks she starts slowly stepping away from the desk while looking around for backup. </p>

<p> Alexa! Am I going to have to reboot the router again? You ask. The librarian replies “South-East of me you will find the newspapers. That's all the news we have. Excuse me." With that she walks towards the front of the library. You walk over to the newspapers and notice that now a library security guard is tracking you with their eyes from afar. </p>
