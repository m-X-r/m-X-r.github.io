<h1> Books on CDs </h1>

<p>
You are now in front of a lot of Cd cases. Thick, gray, and large Cd cases. You open one up and see 20 disks inside!  Itâ€™s like Audible, but on Cd! </p>

<p>You start glancing at the genres and notice they have all kinds. Fiction, Mystery, Nonfiction, and....Western? </p>

<p> Who listens to Westerns on Cd? Do they still sell Cd players? Do Cd players connect to the aux cord in your car? So many questions! </p>

<p>Then an idea hits you, if you check one of these out that would give you a reason to search for a CD player at the thrift store.You pick a set at random. Crossfire Trail 4 disc set. Apparently a rugged soldier of fortune made a promise to a dying friend to watch out for his ranch and his daughter. Now a ruthless local has eyes on both the ranch and the daughter. No wonder what said soldier of fortune will do. Sounds like it will be a good listen maybe. </p>
