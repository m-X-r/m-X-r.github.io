<h1> Richland Library Northeast Branch</h1>

<p> You, a canning aficionado, just finished canning your latest batch. Pickled peaches. The sweetness of the peaches mixing with the sourness of the vinegar makes a surprisingly delicious edition to salads. The downside is that now your entire house smells like vinegar. You open a window, turn on some fans and decide to go out for a bit. You have no plans just hop into the car and start driving. At some point you fall into a sort of highway hypnosis. When you snap out of it, you find yourself parked in front of a library. </p>
