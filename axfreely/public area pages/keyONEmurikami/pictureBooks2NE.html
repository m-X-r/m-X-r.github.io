<h1> Children's picture books </h1>

<p> You are in front of a gaggle of books with slim spines. The spines are so slim that you can't even read the titles of the books. A small child zooms past you grabbing multiple titles. He turns and gives you a thumbs up as leaves. You watch his run off and catch up with a little girl that seems to be his sister. </p>
