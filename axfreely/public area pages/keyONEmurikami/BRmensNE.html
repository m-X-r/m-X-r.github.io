<h1> The Other Bathroom </h1>

<p>You walked into a restroom, apparently, it’s the Men’s restroom because there is a guy standing by the sink. </p>
<p>This guy has a sweatband on with super short shorts and knee-high socks.  His socks are the kind that are white and have the three red bands up towards the top. He seems to be limbering up when he sees you. </p>

<p> His eyes immediately light up and he enthusiastically starts talking to you. </p>
