You get a piece a scrap paper and write a heartfelt message to the attention of your friend. That message being Hey, you suck love you. You fill out a cover sheet with your info and the fax number on your friendâ€™s company website. Once you have everything ready to go you realize you have no clue how to send a fax. You look around and see a sheet taped above the machine that have what look to be direction on it. <p>
