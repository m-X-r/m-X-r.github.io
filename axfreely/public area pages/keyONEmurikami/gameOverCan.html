<p> You and Dan talk canning for a bit at the front desk and then he has to leave. You were leaning on the desk while talking and when you get ready to leave the librarian stops you. </p>

<p> “I think you forgot your card.” She says pointing at a blue business card on the desk. You insist that you had no card and walk out behind Dan. Completely forgetting the chat you had with Ms. Smiley Melanie. You never email her. You never do a canning program at the library. You never become actual Canning King Author. Your story ends with you having one serious canning ted talk in training and then getting hit by a bus. Full of badly canned food. </p>

<p>So sad but so true</p>
