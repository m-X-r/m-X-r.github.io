<h1> Fresh Picks </h1>

<p> You see a bunch of books displayed on a table. In the middle of the table is a fancy sign that says Fresh Picks. You start to think whatâ€™s a fresh pick, when someone starts talking to you like the read your mind. "Fresh Picks all have this yellow sticker on the spine. That means it's a fresh pick. You can't put them on hold or renew them, but it's the best way to get a new popular book quicker than being on hold for it." An older man on the other side of the table said. He must have noticed you looking at the sign. You thank the older man, he kind of grunts, gives you a nod, and then starts walking towards your side of the table. "I'm looking for something good," he says while walking. </p>

<p> You start to "look for something good" as well. Then you see a book with an exciting title by someone named Agatha Christie. The older man sees you looking.  "That's a good one. I just finished it, and it's great for mystery." You thank him for his advice. You dont like mystery books unfortunalty.</p>
