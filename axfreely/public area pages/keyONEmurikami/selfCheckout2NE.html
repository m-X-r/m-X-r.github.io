<h1> Self-Checkout </h1>

<p> You get to the Self-Checkout excited to try it out. Then you see it, the sign telling you it is out of order. Then you hear it, a grunt as someone under the table messing with cords bumps their head. They turn and see you. They look over at the other self-checkout at someone on the floor there. It's going to be a minute, they say, you can loop around and come back later, or you can check out at the Front Desk if you like. </p>
