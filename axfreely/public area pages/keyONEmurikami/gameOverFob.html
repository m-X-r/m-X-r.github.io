<p> Before you can do anything, someone comes out of the door and bumps into you. It’s a Librarian. "Sorry, did you need some help." You start to stutter, how you want to go inside. The Librarian tries to explain to you that the public entrance is around the front of the building and that you are at the staff entrance. You don’t accept that. You stutter some more about wanting to go into the staff entrance. Suddenly a wild urge takes over you, and you attempt to plow past the librarian to see what is behind the clear glass staff door. It closed behind the librarian so your face slams hard into the door, knocking you out. When you awaken, you discover that you have been banned from the library. </p>
