<h1> Tech Help Desk </h1>

<p> "To log in you will need to type in your library card number first. Your card number is on the back of your card under the barcode. Make sure to type the whole number, and be sure to type it into the library card number field on the screen. Next, you need to type your four-digit pin into the pin field on the screen and click submit. Once you click submit the computer will prompt you to accept the library policy and reenter your pin. Be sure to enter the same pin that you entered on the previous screen." You try to ask the Librarian why you would enter in a different pin the second time, but she keeps going. "As long as the information is correct the computer will unlock to the desktop and you will be able to use it." At this point the Librarian stops and stares at you for a moment. Anticipating a question. You get ready to tell her thank you for her time but before you can someone yells at her. Apparently, they want to know what their second pin number is. She smiles at you, sighs and walks over to help them. </p>
