<h1> Blockbuster Knockoff! </h1>

<p> Standing in front of shelves and shelves of movies you have a flashback to your Blockbuster rental days. That is minus the forgot to rewind charge because these are all DVDâ€™s. You get so caught up that you almost miss the fact that they have video games too! All they are missing is the movie size candy. As you are about to walk away you see the wiz on display. If you remember correctly that features Michel Jackson as a scarecrow. You could watch Michel Jackson as a scarecrow right? </p>
