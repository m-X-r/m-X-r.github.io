<h1> Front of the Library </h1>

<p> You are in the front area of the library. It consists of a carpeted floor and open space. </p>
<p> That familiar tile again. You stand a minute to try and place it. You defiantly know it magically from somewhere. You feel a presence next to you and look up to see a librarian. "Hey, I saw you admiring our floor maps. That one is of downtown. You can tell because of the river." OMG! she's right you think. The shock on your face makes the librarian smile. She insists that you let her know if you need any help as she walks off. </p>
