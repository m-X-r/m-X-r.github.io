<h1> RCPL NE Front Door </h1>

<p>
You get ready to open the door but notice something weird. There is a man dancing and stripping off his clothes right past the atrium. The librarians at the front desk are trying to get him to stop. It looks like one of them is waving for you to go around back, while another is waving for you not to come in.
