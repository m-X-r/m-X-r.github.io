<h1 id="END"> Game Over (hot fish grease) </h1>

<p> You attempt to pick up the hot fish, but it's too hot and burns your fingers. You use the plate to kind of flip the fish up into the air and attempt to catch it in your mouth. Odley enough you succeed and catch it in your mouth. Problem is that the fish is still way too hot. Not only does the hot fish burn your mouth but the hot grease starts to flow down your throat. Most of it flows into your stomach, but some shimmies down the wrong pipe, frying your lungs. Before you pass away, you do get to taste a bit of the fish. It was absolutely delicious. Totally worth it was your last thought before you died. </p>
