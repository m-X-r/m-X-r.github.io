<h1> A Booth </h1>

<p> You come across a booth, just like the kind you find in restaurants. Actually, you are certain you saw one just like it in a corner at Olive Garden. The only difference being this one is nicer, and the one at Olive Garden didn't include a bunch of teens staring at you. </p>
<p> “My bad, didn't mean to interrupt.”  You say to them. One teen in the back gives you a nod and says, "It's cool."</p>
