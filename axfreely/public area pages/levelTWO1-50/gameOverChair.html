<h1 id="END"> Game Over (chair) </h1>

<p> You run into the back of a chair that you realize as you are slamming into it has someone sitting in it. You knock the staff member over as you fall. Next thing you know, you are heading towards a bright light through a tunnel of darkness. I guess what Iâ€™m really trying to say is now you are dead. See what had happened was that on the way down, you hit your head against the corner of the desk at a weird angle. Though the paramedics got there very quickly, you were D.O.A. On your tombstone, they wrote, "Not the best library patron, but definitely not the worst. R.I.P" </p>
