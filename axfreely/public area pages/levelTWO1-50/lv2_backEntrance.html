<h1>Into the Glass Door </h1>

<p>
From outside you see a short hallway perpendicular with another as well as a room immediatly to the right and some carpet.
Beige walls, speckled titled ceiling squares, fluorescent lighting, standard office fair.
You open the door and walk in.
The door shuts behind you with a heavy closing clamp, as if it was made of stone instead of glass and aluminum.
Its slightly dimmer than it was before as you find yourself in an open roof stone labyrinth vs the standard office you saw before.
Insted of carpet you find sand beneath your feet.
The climate control has been replaced by arid hot air, no breeze in sight.
The sun above is at an angle right now but you feel soon it will opressivly bearing down upon you, baking you into the sand.
