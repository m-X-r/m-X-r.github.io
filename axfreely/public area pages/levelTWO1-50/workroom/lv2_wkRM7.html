<h1> Fringe Tree </h1>

<p>
You come across a magnificent tree.
Its not super tall but you can tell its been around for a while due to its thick, solid, trunk and limbs.
Its flowers are white and they drape down like a giant beard on a weathered sailor. 
You swear you feel the tree is smiling at you. 
You smile back and say hello, how are you.
</p>
<p>
"Fine, better than fine, Glorious actually! Thanks for asking child" the tree replies
As starteled as you are you swear the tree winks at you.
But how do trees even wink....Before you can think further on it the tree starts talking again.
"Sorry about that, I'm older than most everyone here so I call everyone child. In return they call me old man. You can call me old man too."
<!-- So now things are problimatic. How will i create a mechanism so the old man can tell you about trees as you are introduced to them? I feel ima have to empty this folder and then recreate it over and over for each new tree. yikes! jdc/ss/5.3.24 -->
