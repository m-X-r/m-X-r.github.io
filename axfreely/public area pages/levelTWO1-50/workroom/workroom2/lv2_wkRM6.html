<h1> You walk over to see a Serviceberry Tree. </h1>

<p>
 It's jull of berries ranging in color from green, to red, to black.
 A plethera of different birds are hanging out in its branches.
"Need Bird Language Lessons? I can help....for a fee...that we can settle up on later."
"For right now take this."
A little box with a ribbon wrapped around it tied into a bow drops from a branch.
You pick it up and open it to find an Ipod.
It has a screen, so its not a shuffle and it has corded headphones of all things. 
"Its fully charged, its a translation device."
"If you press the button while a bird talks to you it will transcribe on the screen and translate into the headphones."
"When it dies bring it back to me and we can settle up on the fee."
You try to ask more about the fee, but opening the box was considred you contractually agreeing to settling up on the fee later, according to the Serviceberry Tree.
