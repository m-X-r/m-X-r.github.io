<h1> <a href="https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/magnolia-grandiflora/" target="_blank">Southern Magnolia</a> </h1>

<p>
 You follow the birds towards a magnificent tree.
 This everygreen is very southern aka showy but calm and collect.
 Then suddenly you hear a big booming voice.
</p>
<p>	
 "Friends! How yall doing today, was wondering when Id see yall again.
 Come come and rest your wings in my branches.
 Who's that with ya?
 Whoever ya are you's company, bring that draft for my favorite neighbors."
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/cedar-waxwing" target="_blank" > Waxwings</a> stop dragging the mobile draft and fly off to land in the tree.
You pick it up, examining its ingenuity, and walk over to the tree.
In front of the tree there is some patio furniture and you take a seat.
"Hello new friend, Im Mrs. Margarie, and whos company am I now privileged to enjoy?"
You introduce yourself and tell Mrs. Margarie the width and depth of the experince you've had since you walked into this workroom.
</p>
<p>
"I see, oh yes I do see indeed" Mrs. Margarie exclaims.
(To be fair she does not exclaim, she's just a loud talker, so everything sounds like and exclaim to you.)
"Well, Id be more than willing to wip up some of Mrs. Margarie's Famous Sweet Tea for Cherry and Hawthorn.
You can coun't on me to keep them in generous supply.
Only problem is, they gone need a bit more than my favorite neighbors here.
While I can count on the <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/cedar-waxwing" target="_blank" > Waxwings</a> to deliver the tea They wll need something much bigger and much more moble than that flight you go there to supply Cherry and Hawthorn, them being 20 times <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/cedar-waxwing" target="_blank" > Waxwings</a> size and all.
Hum...You know, I supposed the crows would know what to do about that.
Only they dont come round but every now and then...And the language barrier and all.
But I suppose <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/baltimore-oriole" target="_blank"> Oriole</a> could help with that.
You should go over and ask em, while meand the <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/cedar-waxwing" target="_blank" > Waxwings</a> catchup."
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/cedar-waxwing" target="_blank" > Waxwings</a> start chirping and Mrs. Margarie starts giggling.
"Goone now and git to <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/baltimore-oriole" target="_blank"> Oriole</a> before it gets too late now."
