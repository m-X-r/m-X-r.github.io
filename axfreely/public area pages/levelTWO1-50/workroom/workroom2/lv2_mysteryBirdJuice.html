<h1> You drink the mystery <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/cedar-waxwing" target="_blank"> Cedar Waxwings</a> juice. </h1>

<p>
It, taste like something earthy and familiar, yet sweet.
Really sweet, really really sweet.
Then suddenly you have more energy than you could have every imagined having.
</p>
<p>
Then you get hit in the face with a berry.
You look and see the <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/cedar-waxwing" target="_blank" > Waxwing</a> that brought you here trying to tell you something...but what?
Then it hits you "The Cherry Blossom Tree!" you say aloud.
All the <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/cedar-waxwing" target="_blank" > Waxwings</a> seem to cheer you on at realizing why you were brought.
"Where can I get more?" you ask the group.
The bearers of the flight, pick up the string and start dragging it a new direction.
