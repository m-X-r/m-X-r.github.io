<h1> You run up on a gang, and you are definatley in the wrong hood. </h1>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/cedar-waxwing" target="_blank"> Cedar Waxwing </a> that was chasing you runs into a croud of Waxwings, that were passing berries amongs themselves.
That is until you ran up. Then the leader swallows it and now they are all staring at you.
You put your hands up and freeze.
</p>
<p>
The leader takes a hop towards you, making some very aggresive thin lisping cries.
Suddenly the Waxwing that was chasing you flies and lands next to him.
They have a conversation, then look at you.
The leader then says something to the group, resulting in some other gang members dragging out a mobile flight station. 
</p>
<p>
There are 6 cups in the station. 
All seem to be filled with the same colored liquid, a brown colored liquid, just at various amounts of full across the cups.
The leader and the one that was throwing berries at you seem to be encouraging you to drink.
</p>
