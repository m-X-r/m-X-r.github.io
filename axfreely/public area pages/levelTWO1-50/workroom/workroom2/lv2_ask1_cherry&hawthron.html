<h1> Fringe Tree </h1>

<p>
Oh those two, they are always in there own world. I dont know who taught who, or if they learned it together, but they figured out how to bloom all year long. The Cherry Blossom Tree blooms flowers while the Washington Hawthorn "blooms" berries. They like the way it feels and the company it brings. You couldnt tell how they seemingly ignore everyone who comes by. They hear you, I think its a lot of energy to bloom all the time, energy they can't waste conversating. I sure do wish there was a way to help them with that.
