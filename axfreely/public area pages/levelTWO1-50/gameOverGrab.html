<h1 id="END"> Game Over (grab) </h1>

<p> You grab a bunch of books from different slips of paper stacks and attempt to check out at the front desk. The Librarian at the desk tells you that you can’t check any of the books you grabbed. She said all of them were for other people. You don’t like the sound of that as you had already gotten excited about reading at least two of the books. You decide to loudly with the librarian. Somehow you escalade your loud talk to loud gesturing and before you know it books are flying around everywhere. When did you start throwing them? The cops that showed up reported that it was about 5 minutes after you walked to the desk. </p>
