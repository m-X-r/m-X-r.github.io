<h1> The Glistening </h1>

<p>
You walk past the front door and head towards the glistening. You see a large blue wave. Its a sculpture. The closer you get you swear you can feel a sea breeze and hear sea birds calling. Long sea grass is growing around the sculpture, waving in the breeze. You see a plaquard at eye level as you get closer but you realize the writing seems to have worn down. You want to know more about this wave and why its here. Also you have gotten thirsty so you head back to the front door to go ask a librarian about the statue.
