<h1> Tech Help Desk </h1>

<p>
You hand the librarian the quarter you found in the copier.</p>

<p>I thought about keeping it, you say. Giving it back felt like the good thing to do though, maybe someone else can use it. The librarian thanks you.</p>

<p>"You've done me a real solid. Someone wanted to make some copies just now and they were short. They are still here, I'm going to go get them, they will be so happy." </p>

<p>As the librarian is walking off she turns and says, "I donâ€™t care what anyone says you are alright with me friend." As she heads off you catch a glimpse of her nametag, Jessica.</p>

<p>Guess you are a friend of Jessica now, for whatever that is worth.</p>
