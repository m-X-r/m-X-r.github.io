<h1 id="END"> Game Over (fort) </h1>

<p> You decide to drape your jacket over the table, so it hangs down. It won't stay, so you set a chair on top of the table to hold it. You then crawl under the small table and lay the chair on its side in front of you so the seat and back can block you from view. All the while the Librarian at the front desk has been watching you. As you attempt to fluff up some books as a pillow the Librarian walks into the room. "Have you reserved this room?" she asks. You have not. She explains to you that you need to reserve meeting rooms before using them. Lucky for you the room is available, but you can’t block yourself from view and you will need to take apart the wonderous fort you have made. You let her know that you were just about to take a nap after a long day of construction. "Sorry, no sleeping in the library." The Librarian replies. You crawl out from inside your makeshift fort and grab your jacket. Since you can’t have any fun at the library you decided to go home and make a fort in your living room. It still smells like vinegar and it’s not nearly as fun or satisfying. </p>
