<h1> The Woods </h1>

<p> You walk over to the person signaling you. They back up a step, moving closer into the woods with each step closer you get. Right as they go out of view you hear a sound. Its familiar but strange in this setting. What is it? Soon you forget all about the person that beckoned you to the woods edge completely. All your focus is on this sound. </p>
