<h1> The Tiny Storeroom </h1>

<p> The door unlocks! You walk into a tiny room full of children's toys. Well, that was anticlimactic you think. As you are looking around you see a chair in the corner. It fits fine but it seems like it should be to big for the space. It also seems cozy. So cozy and inviting that you feel a sudden inkling to sit down. You plop down and comfort overwhelms you. You seem to be sinking into the chair. You and the chair becoming one. </p>
