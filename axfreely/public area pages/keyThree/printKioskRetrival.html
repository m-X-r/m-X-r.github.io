<h1> The kiosk </h1>

<p> On the screen of the kiosk, it is asking for your library card number and pin. You notice a scanner under the monitor, so you scan your card and type your pin in. Next you see that you can type in how many copies of each thing you sent to print that you want. You sent ten pics, so you only wish to the default one copy of each job. Right before you hit send you notice that the black and white option is selected. You change that immediately; those bears deserve to be in color. You hit send, and hear the printer startup.  You take one step away from the kiosk and immediately the person behind you has already logged you out and is sending their job to the printer. </p>
