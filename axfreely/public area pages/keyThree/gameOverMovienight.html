<p> You walk over and start touching the panel. For whatever reason you fail to notice that the lights in the building start getting brighter, then darker, then off, then back on, then off again. Everyone else does. Before you know it, the library security guard is behind you. “Could you please stop messing with that panel?” You explain that you are trying to pull up Netflix on the projector. Security says that you can’t do that. You inform them that you have a subscription so its fine. They inform you that you can watch Netflix at home then and if you don’t stop, they will call the cops. As the cop drives you to jail, he agrees that it would be cool to watch Netflix at the library. He insists that maybe you should have suggested that instead of starting a fight. He adds that perhaps when your ban is up you can submit a comment card about it </p>
