<p> As you are flailing about while spouting off "magical" things you donâ€™t realize you have  spectators. A less magical parent sitting with their slightly more magical child. The child is chill but the parent is getting concerned. The parent steps out clutching the child and security walks in. You try to explain to them that if they would just let you use the magic to open the door they would understand. But apparently security are the least magical people at the library because they escort you out all the same. </p>
