<p>You walk over and the man asks you if you have two thousand dollars to give him. You say no. He then asks if you know anyone inside who would have two thousand dollars to give him. You, again say no. He says ok, thanks anyway. </p>
<p>You turn to walk away and the man says hey wait, I know what you can give me. What you ask. He then hacks you to bits and uses the parts he does not eat immediatley to make you-rky. Its like jerky but instead of beef its made out of, well, you.</p>
