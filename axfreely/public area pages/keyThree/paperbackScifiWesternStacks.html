<h1> A Million Little Paperbacks</h1>

<p> You are standing in front of what seems to be a million small paperback books. They are half the height of the shelf and very skinny. You want to pull one out, but that just screams disaster. Since they are so small and skinny they have been packed together really tight. It seems if you take one out they will all fly off the shelf, like a deck of cards. Best to leave checking those out to the experts. </p>
