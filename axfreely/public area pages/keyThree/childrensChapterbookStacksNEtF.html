<h1> Chapter Books? </h1>

<p> As you glance at some American Girl books A lady rushes up and demands to know if you work at the library. Before you can answer she asks…</p>

<p> "Which chapter books are for readers 6+ who read at an N16 level?"</p>

<p>You barely manage to get out, wh..?  When the lady takes a loud, deep, disappointed sigh while frowning deeply. </p>

<p>"Oh, my, goodness!  I just don’t understand why you aren’t helping me. This would have never happened at Cooper!" With that she rushes off. “Sorry.” You say to spine of: Meet Addy and American Girl.</p>
