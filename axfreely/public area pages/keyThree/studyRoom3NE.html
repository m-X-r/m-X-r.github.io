<h1> Study Room #3 </h1>

<p> You see a room through a wall and a door of glass. On the door is a placard that says Study Room 3. It's not a big room. It looks like a comfortable fit for 3-4 ppl that knew each other. The more you gaze through the glass, the cozier the room seems to you. It starts to remind you of spending winters in your grandma's small apartmentâ€”just the two of you building forts and telling ghost stories over hot cocoa. A drastic urge to build a fort in Study Room 3 hits you quite suddenly. </p>
