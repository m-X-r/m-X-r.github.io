<h1> PlayStation Bar </h1>

<p> You are at a high table with bar chairs and neat retro hanging lights. You see someone sitting and working on their laptop on one end of the table. </p>
<p> Sitting in the middle you see a guy with a large screen TV and a PlayStation. Itâ€™s not every day you see a guy with a PlayStation and a large screen TV in the library. So, you start up a conversation with him. He ends up telling you a really long story about his Ex-Girlfriend, ending with the fact that now he has to use the library Wi-Fi to update his gaming system. </p>
