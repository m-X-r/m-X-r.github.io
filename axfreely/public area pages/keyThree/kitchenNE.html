<h1> A Kitchen in a Library? </h1>

<p> You walk back to the lady sliding the white panels. You ask her if there is in fact a stove behind her "There is a stove behind me." She replies with a chuckle. "We just finished up a cooking class we call Monday Bites. Be sure to check the website or the whiteboard upfront to see when our next class is." With that she smiles and closes herself behind the white paneling. Wow you think, this place is fancy. </p>
