<h1> Monday Bites </h1>

<p> You join in the Cooking Class. It just started. The Monday Bites as it’s called is a demo about sautéing with butter. The chef ends up making a pasta with sautéed onions, carrots and shrimp with a peppery creamy white sauce. Everyone got a taste at the end. Best part was that it was not only delicious but it wasn’t nearly as hard to make as you would have thought. </p>

<p>As the class wraps up you go to grab a recipe sheet. You drop it and when you bend down to pick it up you see that it landed on top of a flat round disk with a keyring hooked onto it. It looks very “fobbie,” For lack of a better word. </p>
