<h1> Study Room Two </h1>

<p> You walk into a room with a placard on the door that says Study Room 2. Inside is a TV monitor, some tables and chairs, and a sign that says you must reserve the room before using it. Itâ€™s a big space, and there is a door, those people standing around that high table probably could have a way better secret meeting in here. I Should go mention it to them? You ponder. </p>
