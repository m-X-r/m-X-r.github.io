<h1> Large Print </h1>

<p> You find yourself in front of a shelf of books. They all seem a little thick. Then you spot one you know, neigh, have at home. You know for a fact that book is not that thick. You pick it up and start to flip through when you see what has happened. This copy has bigger type than yours. That’s what’s making the books thicker. You start thinking its nice how they are looking out for the vision impaired with the book still in your hand when an older lady walks up beside you. She smiles and asks if you are going to check it out in a sweet old lady voice. You smile back and hand it over to her, you tell her it’s a good one and that you have a copy at home. She thanks you as she collects the book and heads to the checkout desk. </p>
