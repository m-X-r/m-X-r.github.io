<p> "You will need to go to the fax machine to the South-East of me." Said the librarian, pointing. "Above the fax machine, you will see the directions for operation printed. Just remember if the number is local you do not need to dial the area code first, otherwise dial one and then the area code and the number. Be sure to watch for the screen to say complete, that’s the only way you will know if the fax was sent. I would also call the people to confirm that they got it.” You indicated to the librarian that that was a lot of information. She just kind of shrugged. “It’s all on the direction sheet as well.” With that she turned to help another customer.  </p>
