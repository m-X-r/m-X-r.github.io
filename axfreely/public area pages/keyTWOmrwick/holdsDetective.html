<h1> Holds Shelf </h1>

<p> You examine the little slips of paper sticking out of the books. You see that they all have names on them. You look up and see the sign on top of the shelf that says holds. You figure that these must be for VIPâ€™s who put in some sort of order for pick up. You have to remember to check to see if the library has an app. </p>
