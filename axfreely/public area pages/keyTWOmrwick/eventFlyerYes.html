<h1>The Front Desk </h1>

<p> You and Dan walk to the front desk to book a room. When you get there the Librarian is in a very in-depth conversation with a very smiley lady. As soon as you walk up the smiley lady stops talking and insist that you get whatever you need. She continues to smile and stand by the desk as the Librarian helps you and Dan book the room. After insisting that you will not actually be canning in the room just talking about canning the smiley lady introduces herself to you and Dan. Her name is Melanie and she thinks that your event sounds like fun She ends up giving you her card and insisting that you email her about your event and she walks away.  You look back to the Librarian and she just has a very shocked and impressed look on her face. Before you can figure out what the look was about Dan starts asking you canning questions.
