<h1> the Card Catalog </h1>

<p> You come across a Computer with a sign on it that says Card Catalogue. A small part of you wishes that it was one of those retro wooden shelf systemsâ€”one filled with thousands of index cards with titles and dewy decimal numbers on them. </p>
<p> Then you remember how complicated that was after making a 1 second search for a book. How did people do this before computers! </p>
