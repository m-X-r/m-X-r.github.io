<h1> The Front Desk </h1>

<p> “Congratulations!” </p>

<p> The librarian sounds very excited about your library card as she hands it to you. You were admiring your new card as she started to tell you about all the things the library had to offer. Towards the tail end you could have sworn you heard her say something about power tools. Before you could ask someone interrupted her to ask a question. They seemed demanding and what they wanted seemed complicated so you walk off to explore the library. </p>
