<h1> The Large Conference Room</h1>

<p> You walk into a large room. It has lots of tables and chairs, surprisingly it also has multiple sinks. As you are looking at the sinks you hear a noise and look up. At the back of the room you see a lady sliding the white panels that make up the wall away. Behind her, you see a kitchen. Since when does the library have a secret kitchen! </p>
