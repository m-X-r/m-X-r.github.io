<p> The more you ponder the fact that this place has an entire area they specifically call the Cafe YET you can’t have food in the building it just makes you madder and madder. You decide to raid the printer tray while the Librarian is away. You steal a pen and start making protest signs. Cafe means Food! Food Lives Matter! We deserve drinks with a non-closing cap! You don’t have any tape so you use bits of gum to post your signs. Librarians start to surround you, asking you to please stop. When security shows up you start to chant and yell all your sign slogans. Years later inside your padded cell you are still yelling. Sometimes they give you paper so that you can make signs. </p>
