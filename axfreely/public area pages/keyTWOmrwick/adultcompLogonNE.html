<h1> Adult Computer Floor </h1>

<p>
You pull out your new library card and type in your number. It would be great if you could scan your card somehow instead of typing this long number in.</p>

<p>Next you type in your 4-digit pin.</p>

<p>Then, the screen has the audacity to ask you to type in your pin again! Rude.</p>

<p>Finally, the computer unlocks for you.</p>
