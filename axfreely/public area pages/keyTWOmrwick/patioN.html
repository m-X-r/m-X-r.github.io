<h1> The Patio </h1>

<p> You walk through some bushes and end up beside a trash can. You see a smaller parking lot, it has to be for staff. Some lady was in the middle of getting into her car when you “arrived.” She sits for a while looking at you, you decided to stand there and stare at her. You hear the car locks activate and she suddenly starts alternating between staring at you and staring down. Next thing you know a security guard has walked out the back door, heading straight for you. You stare at the lady in the car, then you stare at the security guard who stopped a safe distance away from you. “Hey buddy, you can’t hang out back here, you have to keep moving.” Security and the lady in the car are both staring at you. Waiting to see what you are going to do next. <p>
