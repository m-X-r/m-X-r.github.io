<h1> The High Table </h1>

<p> You decide to walk back to the High Table even though the conversation seems to have resumed after you left it stops dead in its tracks again as you re approach. You apologize to the group for your interruption and explain to them how to book a meeting room. You add how you just thought that would make them happy and you decided to share. A large and imposing gentleman stands up from the table and walks towards you. He puts a hand on your shoulder and then a warm smile crosses his face. “Thank you for your kindness in informing us of the room. The next time we meet here we will be sure to use of that space. We saw it after our meeting started but were unsure of the protocol.” He gives your shoulder a playful shake and then hands you a large gold coin. “Take this as a token of our gratitude," You thank him for the gift. You look down at the coin and notice that one side has a large skull on it, the other has some cryptic writing. You look back up to ask the man about how to use the coin and you see that everyone in the meeting is now gone. You didn’t even here them all walk away. Goes to show you can be large but incredibly light and nimble. </p>
