<h1> The Parking Lot </h1>

<p>
You jump in your car and notice a flyer on your windshield. The brochure says Mr. Seafood, delicious seafood, in big, bold letters. Hum, you think seafood would be excellent. You decided to head out to get some.</p>

<p>At Mr. Seafood's you get a whitefish basket to go. While waiting to pull out the parking lot you see Sunshine Thrift Store across the street. Suddenly you remember needing a CD player for something. You pull into the thrift store, but your fish smells so good.</p>
