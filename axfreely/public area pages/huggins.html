<h1>Smiley Director </h1>

<p>You see the smiley Ms. Melanie heading to leave out the front door. You catch her before she gets out and loop her into you and Dan's canning convo. Dan even invites her to the meeting. She explains how she's been interested in canning for a while but never got around to trying it. She goes on to say how she just so happens to be the on the Executive Leadership Team of the library and loves community partnerships. She mentions the word MOU when phone buzzes. </p>

<p> The way her face changed when she looked at her phone you can tell she has to run. She looks up and begins to excuse herself but she insists that you email her. Actually, just take this you can use it to talk to the Culinary Arts Coordinator. She rushes off with that. You look into your hand and you see something Fobby. It's a black flat disk with a key ring on it. </p>
