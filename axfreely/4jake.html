<h1>For Jake:</h1>

<p id="question" >I started this experience to just walk people around my branch of the county library system. Then it evolved, then I casted my coworkers, then I let Jake playtest it. He was super excited about it. Then It grew, and now I have no idea whats going on and its in constant progress. Today if you play you may get a different game than next week. One day Jake will get to play the "complete" edition, or maybe constant fluxis its final form. Only time will tell. In the mean time, enjoy. <br>2.7.23</p>
