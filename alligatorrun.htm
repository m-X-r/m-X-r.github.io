You are out of breath because cardio is sooo not your thing and you sit on the curb and try to convince your heart that it's not freaking out. Who in the hell lets a 6...or was she 8....little kid ages are hard. She was def less than 10. Who in the hell lets a 10 year old hang out with a full grown alligator! At least I think it was full grown....I really need to read more, you think.
