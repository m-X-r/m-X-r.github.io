<p> ONE <br>
We enter this story with a bunny, a space pirate bunny, drifting alone, in space. The bunny spins and spins hurtiling through the cold and darkness of space, to nowhere. The bunny, inside its space suit equipt with a rebreather that turns space dust into breathable air. There is more dust in space than you would realize so though the bunny is in no danger of suffocation she is still not safe. Freefloating in space is very dangerous, yet the bunny floats on, seemingly indifferent to its situation.</p>

<p id="bun">"indifferent my a*&!"</p>

<p> Oh! I didnt realize that you could hear me...</p>

<p id="bun">"of course i can hear you, you are talking about me in the same 'room' for lack of a better term rather loudly. come on it's not like there are any other sounds in space! to be clear i'm not indifferent, i'm thinking. plotting to be more specific. as you have obviously noticed i have some time to kill before i can do anything but float through space attempting to not die."</p>

<p> Plotting? </p.>

<p id="bun"> yeah, plotting my perfect revenge. dont act like you dont know what happen, you were there. {because you are everywhere}"</p>

<p> I see, well right now we have guest and they dont know what happen. Would you like to catch them up?</p>

<p id="bun">"why dont you tell them. are you not playing at narrator? i refuse to keep doing everyones job! I just dont understand...." 
</p>

<p> As the bunny gets more and more agitated join me my dear spectators in this <a href="spb1.html" >flashback.</a></p>

<p>TWO <br>
First things first, do you know how space pirate bunnies are made?</p>

<p>Sorry to disappoint but its not sugar, spice, and everything nice. As you should know everyone is essentially made up of star dust. That once bored of its current form dustifies again, makes it way back to space, mixes, mingles, makes agreements then morphs into a new more exciting arrangement. When it comes to space dust agreements birds of a feather typically flock together, but in the case of space pirates not so much. Space pirates are tribal but every new pirate is an imalgination of an unlikely dust pairing sprinkled in with some dust from all the other space pirates. Like an Avitar or a Trill or a Borg type hive mind ansestory situation with a large dose of unique abilities and characteristics based off that unique unexpected combo. Space pirates once formed can change forms but tend to mix and mingle less. They tend to pillage and stockpile unique dusts whos form they choose. At one point the trend was gold coins, everyone has all this "gold" horded away, personally I never got behind that trend.</p>
