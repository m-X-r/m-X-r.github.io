<p>TWO <br>
First things first, do you know how space pirate bunnies are made?</p>

<p>Sorry to disappoint but its not sugar, spice, and everything nice. As you should know everyone is essentially made up of star dust. That once bored of its current form dustifies again, makes it way back to space, mixes, mingles, makes agreements then morphs into a new more exciting arrangement. When it comes to space dust agreements birds of a feather typically flock together, but in the case of space pirates not so much. Space pirates are tribal but every new pirate is an imalgination of an unlikely dust pairing sprinkled in with some dust from all the other space pirates. Like an Avitar or a Trill or a Borg type hive mind ansestory situation with a large dose of unique abilities and characteristics based off that unique unexpected combo. Space pirates once formed can change forms but tend to mix and mingle less. They tend to pillage and stockpile unique dusts whos form they choose. At one point the trend was gold coins, everyone has all this "gold" horded away, personally I never got behind that trend.</p>
