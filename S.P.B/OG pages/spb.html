We enter this story with a bunny, a space pirate bunny, drifting alone, in space. The bunny spins and spins hurtiling through the cold and darkness of space, to nowhere. The bunny, inside its space suit equipt with a rebreather that turns space dust into breathable air. There is more dust in space than you would realize so though the bunny is in no danger of suffocation she is still not safe. Freefloating in space is very dangerous, yet the bunny floats on, seemingly indifferent to its situation.</p>

<p id="bun">"indifferent my a*&!"</p>

<p> Oh! I didnt realize that you could hear me...</p>

<p id="bun">"of course i can hear you, you are talking about me in the same 'room' for lack of a better term rather loudly. come on it's not like there are any other sounds in space! to be clear i'm not indifferent, i'm thinking. plotting to be more specific. as you have obviously noticed i have some time to kill before i can do anything but float through space attempting to not die."</p>

<p> Plotting? </p.>

<p id="bun"> yeah, plotting my perfect revenge. dont act like you dont know what happen, you were there. {because you are everywhere}"</p>

<p> I see, well right now we have guest and they dont know what happen. Would you like to catch them up?</p>

<p id="bun">"why dont you tell them. are you not playing at narrator? i refuse to keep doing everyones job! I just dont understand...." 
</p>

<p> As the bunny gets more and more agitated join me my dear spectators in this <a href="spb1.html" >flashback.</a></p>
