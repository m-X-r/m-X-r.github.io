<!--specific/relevant-->
<!--What are your coding goals? Why are these your goals?-->
<td>I want to make a game using unity that features printed(pref litho-ed) paper art, 3d(flatpacks), and 2d (paper figures, pop-up book art) as the sole artform. I want to also create sounds for this, and I want to enjoy playing it personally. Because I think it would be cool. I like litho, and the last time I made a stop motion with paper, I had a great time. I discovered coding, and I want to make a video game. I want to learn blender, but I want to do it with paper because I'm a printmaker. I also want to host all my games on my own webpage. (like if i could host my own server i would)</td>

<li>learn blender</li>
<li>do litho again</li>
<li>master stop motion with paper</li>
<li>design better pop up book scenery </li>
<li>figure out how to figure flatpacks into stop motion (or as merch)</li>
<li>screenprint cool promotioal posters (for no reason like card guy heck maybe make cards)</li>
<li>learn how to take good photos</li>
<li>learn how to create music/sounds for games</li>

<!--What does your Dream Project look like fully completed? -->
<td>As a completed project, my dream project looks like a digital, interactive experience. This experience feels "cool," for lack of a better word visually. The project overall looks handmade, making you think differently about what you think.</td>

<!--What does your Dream Project look like broken down into smaller parts? -->
<td>I'm not sure what my dream project looks like, broken down into smaller parts. My best guess is, each game must have story, images, music, and mechanics. So those parts?</td>

<!--What do you need to know to create the smallest part of your Dream Project? -->
<td>To create the smallest part of my dream project. I need a compelling story.</td>

<!--What message are you trying to communicate with this project? -->
<td>The message I want to communicate is, hey! I think this is cool! Also, you should reconsider how you consider, because life is crazy and mean, and I am determined to shake you out of your box. You'll thank me later.</td>

<!--How will you be able to tell what reactions your audience is having to your project? -->
<td> I would love to have some sort of call to action that would help gauge my audience's reaction. At the moment, though, I can only guess that I would have to rely on reviews of the project and general comments about it. </td>

<td>I am torn on how my project looks. On the one hand, I want to distribute my project on a physical storage device equipped with self-made packaging and extras. On the other hand, I want to interact with my audience digitally, so maybe by hosting the project online with a forum or comment feature. Without knowing how I want that to work, I can't think of what makes it look that way. Maybe I should start mocking up both or find a middle option that does a little of both.</td>

<!-- Could you change how your audience engages with your project? What difference would that make? -->

<!-- What tasks do you need to complete? Which ones are more important? Why? -->

<!--What accomplishments would you consider most important in your project timeline? -->
<td>Fully completing the story development of a project is an essential accomplishment for me.</td>

<!-- Is your audience's interaction dependent on you putting out some sort of content? -->
<td>I want to provide some sort of content to help fuel interaction within the project's community when it comes to the project itself, the only audience interaction needed with be the audience's initial experience.</td>

<!-- Is audience interaction dependent only on some sort of advertisement plan? Why or why not? What encourages people to interact with your project? -->
<td>I need to make a separate development plan for this community idea to flesh out what will encourage people to interact with it. As far as my project goes, I just hope word of mouth encourages people to interact with it. Word of mouth is not a great plan, though, so I need to come up with another one.</td>
