<h1>Seventh Key Point</h1>

<h2>"The next day the wolf invited the pig to a fair in town that very afternoon. The pig agreed but left earlier than the appointed time. At the fair he bought a butter churn. On his way home, the pig saw the wolf before the wolf saw him and jumped in the churn and rolled down the hill towards the wolf. The wolf was frightened and ran away."</h2>

<p>Now, we will continue just like before and add a space after Path to Town 5. This time we are going to make a Hill, so the pig with have something to roll down to scare the wolf. It will be uphill going towards town and downhill going towards the Third Pigs House. We donâ€™t have to put that in the box but we do need to keep it in mind when we start to code.</p>
