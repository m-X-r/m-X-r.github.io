<h1> Cascading Style Sheet </h1>

So, when me made our pages we added a link in the head to a style sheet we named threeLittlePigsStyles.css. The only information we saved in the style sheet was body{padding:60px}, this gave us 60 pixels of space bordering the top, bottom, left, and right of our webpage.

<p>
We are now going to go back into our CSS page and center our text as well as change how our compass options look.
