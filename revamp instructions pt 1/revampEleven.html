<h1>The Most Important Step</h1>

<p>The first thing we need to do to start coding, is decide where we want to save our files. Saving is the MOST IMPORTANT part of coding. You will not be able to run your code unless you save it somewhere. With html its best to save all your files in the same place, as they depend on each other to work. Decide if you want to save your files on your computer, an online cloud storage service like google drive, or a flash drive (you can even pick all three if you like). I prefer to save on a flash drive and back up my files to an online cloud storage service. I move around a lot so I'm always using different computers, so the portability of a flash drive works best for me.</p>

<p>Once you decide where you will be working create a folder and name it three little pigs rpg. When coding you dont always use spaces like you do when typing so when you create your folder you need to use the underscore as space like this use_underscore_as_spaces_. </p>

<p>You can also string every word together notating new words by using a capital letter. Like this, stringEverythingTogetherUsingUpperCaseLettersToBreakUpWords. If you do string everything together be sure to start with a lower case letter instead of an upper case letter.</p>
