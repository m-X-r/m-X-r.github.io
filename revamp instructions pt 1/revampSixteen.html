I bet you are feeling like a programmer now, now that you can see some text on screen! Drink it in, because you are about to see a lot more. We are going to make another page, The Well at Mom Pigs House map spot. To do this create a new notepad document and save it as momPigsHouseWell.html. Use the example above but add your own version about what the pigs encounter at the well. Need inspiration? Here is what I came up with:</p>

<h2>
&lt!Doctype html&gt 
<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lttitle&gt Mom Pigs House Well &lt/title&gt
<br>

&lth1&gt Mom Pigs House Well &lt/h1&gt
<br>
<br>
&ltp&gt<br>
The pigs walked to the family well. The third pig drew up the bucket and took a sip. The second pig nocked the bucket out of his hand. "What are you doing?" He exclaimed! "We need to go find our fortune, it’s not at the well!" The first pig chimed in "He's right, let’s go." Which way do they go?
<br>&lt/p&gt
<br>
<br>
&ltul&gt<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go North &lt/a&gt <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go South &lt/a&gt <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go East &lt/a&gt <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href=""&gt Go West &lt/a&gt <br>
&lt/ul&gt
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &lt/body&gt<!--/BODY-->
<br>
<br>
&lt/html&gt
</h2>

<p>
Now that we have two pages lets fill in one of our a tags. Keeping in mind that we have our Mom Pigs House Well page open, and that Mom Pigs House is West of the Well lets fill in the West tag on this page. All your html pages must be saved in the same place so that they can work together. So make sure that all your pages are saved in the same folder. Now, in between the " " marks of the &lta href=  &gt Go West &lt/a&gt you need to type in the entire file name of the Mom Pigs House page.</p>

<h2>
&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href="momPigsHouse.html"&gt Go West &lt/a&gt <br>
</h2>

<p>Now, the most important step, lets save. Now we can open up our Mom Pigs House page in notepad. In the Go East a tag put in the filename for the Mom Pigs House Well page.</p>

<h2>&nbsp &nbsp &ltli&gt &lta href="momPigsHouseWell.html"&gt Go East &lt/a&gt <br></h2>

<p>Now when you finish, reload your Mom Pigs House web page. It should look something like this when you open it in the browser:</p>

<img src="pictures/momPigsHouseLinked.JPG" alt="Mom Pigs House Linked">

<p>Once you click the East link you should see something like this:</p>

<img src="pictures/momPigsHouseWell.JPG" alt="momPigsHouseWell.jpg">

<p>If you click Go West on your Mom Pigs House Well page it should take you back to your Mom Pigs House page.
