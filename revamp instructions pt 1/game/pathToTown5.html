<h1> Path to Town </h1>

<p>
"Well, we can't just build our house in the path to town." The third pig said, "so where are we going to build it?"</p>
<p>"How about just off the path, right next to that lake front. It will provide plenty of mud for our bricks!" The Man exclaimed pointing West.</p>
<p>"I like it!" The third pig said, "all that free mud is going to make great bricks."</p>
<p>"We will make the sturdiest house around." The Man added.</p>
<p>The pig and the Man smiled at each other as they set off towards the West.</p>
