<h1> Man with Brick </h1>

<p>"I'm sorry to hear that," the man said "I think you would have made an amazing apprentice. Since you appreciate my work so much, I would love to give you these bricks."</p>
<p>"Thank you so much, I was going to ask you If I could build a house out of them." The pig replied.</p>
<p>"If you will allow me I'd love to help you build it." The man said with a hopeful look in his eye.</p>
<p>"I'd love that!" The third pig said.</p>
<p> Together they gathered up the bricks and looked for a place to build their house. While building the house the third pig decided to become the man's apprentice after all. Partners in life, and partners in love, the man and the pig lived more or less happily ever after.</p>

<p>The End.</p>

<p>Still not the end we are looking for! This is the three little pigs, not a Disney princess film! I feel at this point you know what to do. </p>
