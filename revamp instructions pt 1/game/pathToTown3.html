<h1> Path to Town </h1>

<p>
"Well, you can just build your house in the path to town." The third pig said, "so where are you going to build it?"</p>
<p>"Just off the path, duh!" The first pig exclaimed.</p>
<p> "How about over there?" The second pig chimed in pointing West. "It looks nice and flat over there, great place to build a house."</p>
<p>"A flimsy house." The third pig added.</p>
<p>"You know what brother, oh, I mean my real and truest brother. I agree with you, that spot to the West looks perfect." The first pig said while giving the third pig some side eye.</p>
