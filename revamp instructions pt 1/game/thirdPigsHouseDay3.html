<h1> Third Pigs House </h1>

<p>The next day as they were eating breakfast, the man and the pig heard a tumultuous knock at the door.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey, hey! It's me, the wolf from yesterday! I went to the tree, I was early, or at least I thought I did. I woke up after dark on the path almost to the tree. I did not see you there."</p>
<p>"Weird." Said the pig, "maybe you should go see a doctor."</p>
<p>"Maybe you are right," said the wolf. "Hey how about you let me in and share some of those apples, you got some right?" The wolf asked.</p>
<p>"How about I don't do that." The pig replied, "whatever you have may be catching." </p>
<p>"Fine, fine, I'll go visit the doctor." Said the wolf. "In the meantime, how about this. There is a fair in town this afternoon. I will go into town now to visit the doctor and then after you can meet me at the fair. How about we meet around five? Does that sound good?"</p>
<p>"Hum, I guess, as long as you bring a doctor's note." Said the pig "See you later at the fair maybe." With that the wolf walked away with a tremendous smirk. The man looked at the pig. "Do you think they have candy for our apples at the fair?" The man said to the pig.</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="fairNo.html">"I do not know, and I do not really care. I'm not about to go to that fair!" Said the third pig. </a></li>

    <li> <a href="fairYes.html">"I hope so, maybe they have some butter for our pies too!" The pig said. </a></li>
</ul>
