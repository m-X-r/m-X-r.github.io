<h1> Apple Tree </h1>

<p>The next day at breakfast the man convinced the third pig to go to the apple tree with him.</p>
<p>"It will be fine, I will take a few bricks with me to throw at the wolf just in case," the man assured.</p>
<p>So, the third pig and the man headed out to the apple tree. They picked lots of apples with plans of apple pie. They were just talking about making the perfect brick stove to crisp the edges of the pie just right when the pig, from the tree branches, spotted the wolf.</p>
<p>"He's coming! the pig stress whispered down to the man.</p>
<p>The man peered around the tree and saw the wolf coming. The man threw a brick to the right of the wolf, when the wolf turned his head to look the man lobed a brick right at his head. It knocked the wolf out. With the wolf down the pig jumped out the tree and him and the man ran home.</p>
