<h1> Down-Hill </h1>

<p>
The man, in a panic, threw the candy for the apples down the hill at the wolf. The wolf never saw the man but he did see the candy suddenly. "Nice!" he said and gobbled it all up.</p>
<p>He ate it so fast that he got a piece stuck in his throat. While the wolf was choking the man was shaking the pig to try and get him to snap out of his stupor. The pig finally snaped out of it, "what's wrong!" He cried.</p>
<p>"The wolf is coming!" The man anger whispered. They both looked down the hill and saw the wolf laid out on the ground.</p>
<p>"What happen to him?" They said simultaneously.</p>
<p>The man and the pig made their way down the hill. They inched up on the wolf very cautiously. They saw the candy clutched in the wolfs hand as well as the weird bulgy look in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh wow," the man said.</p>
<p>"Yeah," replied the pig, "I don't think he made it."</p>
<p>"You know what that means right? The man said.</p> 
<p>"Um, that we can go back to the fair?"</p>
<p>"Well, technically, yes. I was going to say you are sa..." </p>
<p>The pig cut the man off "Let's go back!" </p>
<p>So, the man and the pig went back to the fair, and they had a wonderful afternoon. So wonderful in fact that they went back every day until the fair was over. Every year after that the third pig was sure to go to the fair. He became a fair ambassador; everyone knew him as the Mayor of the Fair Pig. He produced so many new and inventive ideas to make the fair better. He started a big parade and FanFair for the start and end of the fair. He produced a big best fair food competition. He even started a yearlong design committee that proposed a new ride for the fair every year. He was loved an appreciated for his love and appreciation of the Fair for the rest of his days.</p>
<p>The End. </p>
</p>
<p>But is it? NO! True, in the story of the three little pigs the third pig lives and the wolf perishes, but he perished going down a chimney, not choking on candy! Game Over, immediately!
