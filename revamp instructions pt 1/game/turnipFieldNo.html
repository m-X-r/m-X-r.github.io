<h1> The Turnip Field </h1>

<p>The next day at 12 noon, the third pig and the man walked to the turnip field. They collected so many turnips! When they got home, they started a turnip stew, they prepared some turnips to be dried, they canned some turnips, they even roasted a few. "Man, that tip about the turnip field was the best!" Said the man.</p>
<p>"Right! I really hope he comes back tomorrow with another great tip." said the pig.</p>
<p>"By the way," the man said, "you do realize he was only trying to get you in that field to eat you right?"</p>
<p>"Never trust a wolf," the pig said, "typically they are only trying to eat you. Everyone knows that!"</p>
<p>"Everyone does." Replied the man.</p>
<p>The man and the pig gave each other a high five and then they ate the most delicious turnip stew. </p>
