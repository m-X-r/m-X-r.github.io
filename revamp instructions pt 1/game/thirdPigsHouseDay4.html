<h1> Third Pigs House </h1>

<p>The next day as they were eating breakfast, the man told the pig everything that happen at the hill. The pig said that rolling down that hill was one of the best parts of the fair for him. He was about to suggest that they do it again that afternoon when they heard a tumoltuos knock at the door. "Hey, hey, hey! Its me, the wolf from yesterday! I went to the tree, I was early, Or at least I thought I did. I woke up after dark on the path almost to the tree. I didnt see you there." "Weird." Said the pig, "maybe you should go see a doctor." "Maybe you are right," said the wolf. "Hey how about you let me in and share some apples, you got some right?" The wolf asked. "How about I dont do that." The pig replied, "whatever you have may be catching." "Fine, fine, I'll go visit the doctor." Said the wolf. "In the mean time how about this. There is a fair in town this afternoon. I will go into town now to visit the doctor and then after you can met me at the fair. How about we meet around five? Does that sound good?" "Hum, I guess, as long as you bring a doctors note." Said the pig "See you later at the fair maybe." With that the wolf walked away with a tremendous smirk. The man looked at the pig. "Do you think they have candy for our apples at the fair?" The man said to the pig.
