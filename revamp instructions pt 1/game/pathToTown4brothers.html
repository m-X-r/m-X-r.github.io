<h1> Path to Town </h1>

<p>"I hope he will be alright without me," the third pig said to mostly himself. "He's a big boy, he should be fine, I need to get going."</p>
<p>The third pig was even more worried about his brothers now, this being the only time he had ever been alone. But he felt it was best to stay strong. So, he got back on the road to town in order to find his fortune. Keeping in mind what the Man with straw had said. There was no going back, only forward, and maybe to the side.
