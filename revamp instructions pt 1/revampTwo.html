<h1>Note the Key Points</h1>


<p>
Now that you have finished reading the story Lets go over the key points that we will use to direct our narrative and help guide our decisions regarding character development. They will also help us create a map of the area that this story takes place in. Most the decisions that the character will have to make will be location based.

<ol>
	<li>A Mom Pig sent her three kids off to seek their fortunes.</li>

	<li>The First Pig met a man with straw and asked for it to build a house. The First Pig then built a house. After the house was built a wolf came and asked to come in, threatened The First Pig said no. In return the wolf blew down his house and ate him.</li>

	<li>The Second Pig met a man with Furze (an evergreen shrub) and asked to build a house out of it. The Second Pig then built a house. After the house was built a wolf came and asked to come in, threatened The Second Pig said no. In return the wolf blew down his house and ate him.</li>

	<li>The Third Pig met a man with bricks and asked to build a house out of them. The third Pig then built a house. After the house was built a wolf came and asked to come in, threatened The Third Pig said no and the wolf attempted to blow down the house. The wolf tried and tried but could not blow down The Third Pigs house.</li>

	<li>The wolf then invited the pig to come and get turnips with him the following evening. The pig agreed but left earlier than the appointed time and got the turnips home before the wolf showed up.</li>

	<li>The wolf upset invited the pig to collect apples with him the following evening. The pig agreed but left earlier than the appointed time. The trip took longer than expected and he ran into the wolf while up in the apple tree. The wolf inquired about the apples and the pig threw him one, but he threw it far enough for him to run home.</li>

	<li>The next day the wolf invited the pig to a fair in town that very afternoon. The pig agreed but left earlier than the appointed time. At the fair he bought a butter churn. On his way home, the pig saw the wolf before the wolf saw him and jumped in the churn and rolled down the hill towards the wolf. The wolf was frightened and ran away.</li>

	<li>Later the wolf went to tell the pig how freighted he was and the pig admitted that it was him who frightened the wolf. At this the wolf got very upset and threatened to come down the chimney after the pig.</li>

	<li>The pig had a pot of water and a blazing fire ready so as the wolf came down the chimney he fell into the pot and the pig covered the pot, cooked the wolf, then ate him.</li>
