<h1>Fifth Key Point</h1>

<h2>"The wolf then invited the pig to come and get turnips with him the following evening. The pig agreed but left earlier than the appointed time and got the turnips home before the wolf showed up."</h2>

<p>Now for this point we get to add some new map! No more Pig Houses! We must decide where the Turnip Field is in relation to the Third Pigs House. Now in the illustration on Hoopla I see a tree lined lake front behind the Third Pig. I donâ€™t think that lake front would be on the Path to Town so we should make a new path. This new path will be less of a path and more of a lake front.</p>

<p> As you can see I decided to put the lake front to the West of the Third Pigs House. Instead of that remaining a Cannot Pass Area. It happens so try not to get caught up on your current version of the map being the final version. Its easier to correct something that exist than it is to create the perfect thing from scratch. Lets put the Turnip Field on the other side of the Lake Front.</p>

<p>Then we can block off everything else. At least for now. </p>

<p>Now we have finished the fifth Key Point!</p>
