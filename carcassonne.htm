Sure says Alligator. You sit down and enjoy a lovely game. During the game you learn that Alligator has been a stay at home parent all Anna's life. When she was born I just did'n't want to leave her. So Alligator got a job working from home and plays board games with Anna as much as possible. You know except that one time they went looking for gold. As you are about to say your goodbys Anna suddenly jumps up and looks out the window. I want to go to the Moon she exlaims. Want to come? Her and Alligator look at you.
