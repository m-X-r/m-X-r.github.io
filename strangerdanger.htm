Stranger Danger?
</h1>

<p>
The doorway figure keeps talking to you in a yell whisper. You just ran from that little girl down the street's house didn't you? Shes always trying to get folks to play boardgames with her and her alligator. Yeah! you reply just a little too loud. Who lets a kid play with an alligator! I think that thing ate her parents and now its raising her the stranger replies. You wanna come in, they ask.
