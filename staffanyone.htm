Shhhhhhhhh!

Exuse me sir, but I'm going to have to ask you to lower your voice. A librarian suddenly appeared in front of you. You knew the person had to be a librarian just because they looked like one. Glasses, sweater, shussing you, etc. 

<ul>  
   <li>So, can you tell me how the books work?  <a href="openthemanual0.htm">}={</a></li>

   <li>Is there a computer I can use here? <a href="guestpasspleaseinperson.htm">}={</a></li>

   <li>Jesus, didn't you see me walk in? No greeting at the door? What do you even do here?!  <a href="ohreallyintoalibrarycard.htm">}={</a></li>
</ul>
