Strange 2 0
</h1>

<p>
You walk into your new stranger friends dim house and settle in on his couch. How can an alligator raise a child, you know without eating them, you ask your new stranger friend's back as he walks into the other room. He comes back with a glass of water and a can of seltzer. I've been wondering the same thing. You gulp down beverage and keep talking, I mean that girl looked like she was 8, did it raise her the whole time or is it a new situation, if so how is she so cool with it. Hum your new stranger friend says, I really dont know how you can be around anyone too long without eating them. how long? You say, the room seems like its spinning. At this point your stranger pal says like within the first 5 minutes of meeting someone I want to eat them. Why is this couch sticky? Blood he replies as you pass out.
