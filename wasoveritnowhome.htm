Xbox live
</h1>

<p>
So you got home and pulled up Xbox live, after stopping by a gas station and getting a cold starbucks latte thing. You spazed on contacting {redacted} who actually joined in the game you were playing and tried to message you. So of course you got ghosted as you ghosted. Its a life of Xbox live and gas station starbucks for you.
